<p>Fall season was very busy for Esha and Kelvin, as many friends visited NY from out of town. On 10/16, they went to The Rubin Museum with Steven and Evelyn to see a new exhibit about Himalayan culture and art. Amongst numerous paintings and statues, there was a room with a giant HD panorama of a village that wrapped around all four walls, where they spent a while studying all the fine details.</p>

<p>The main attraction of the museum was the Mandala Lab, an interactive area relating the senses to colors and spiritual centers. Presented with a mirror for reflection and introspection above a series of tubes labeled ‚ÄúArrogance‚Äù, ‚ÄúEntitlement‚Äù, ‚ÄúInferiority‚Äù, and ‚ÄúGloating‚Äù, Kelvin quickly grabbed a token and threw it under ‚ÄúI think I am better than others.‚Äù Esha had a little more shame and thought about it for a bit, but ultimately slid her token in the same tube. The roughly equal heights of the token stacks made for a nice statistical symmetry.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/tSLP2J64QbeQpsf9etDgwQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Next, they took turns reacting to different smells chosen by artists meant to evoke particular emotions. Most of the scents were calming or whimsical, but a cigarette smoke spray was most unpleasant. After some calming meditation and drawing Bubbles PoseTM for healing, everyone went to channel their anger by banging on gongs, then dispersing the energy in a pool of water. Esha had some pretty loud hits, while Kelvin‚Äôs technique was more refined from his percussion training.</p>

<p>When they finished making their way through the rest of the art exhibit, they stopped by a few stores for Esha and Evelyn to look at house plants and decor. Then on the way back to PATH, they came upon a pet store with an extremely outgoing kitty named Leila.</p>

<p>On the 19th, everyone hopped back to 23rd Street to experience Sleep No More, which they had heard about from a number of friends. Of course, this was first preceded by trying a new restaurant, a modern Middle Eastern place called Shukette. Steven and Evelyn had very similar ideas to Esha and Kelvin, and they ordered two each of the frena, lamb sfeeha, and Joojeh chicken, as well as Not Your Average Hummus to share. A short walk later, they arrived at McKittrick Hotel, where they were directed through a dark hallway to the concierge, who had them lock up their phones. The waiting room was an early 1900‚Äôs style bar and stage, which presented an interesting vibe as the guests mingled and were given poker cards for access. While Evelyn was instantly called and whisked away into the Hotel, the rest of the group was held back, so Esha used the time to down a Halloween special cocktail at the bar. When it was finally their turn to enter, they were presented with masks to distinguish themselves from the actors and actresses, then set free into the Sleep No More experience. Esha and Kelvin random walked down a couple of floors, until the maid character caught Kelvin‚Äôs interest with her sus expressions, and they followed her perspective for a while. They witnessed much plotting, murder, and infidelity as they wound through the Hotel following the story, getting lost and switching characters a few times along the way. While the acting and ambience were striking, the overall experience was a bit disjointed and confusing - the full plot was somewhat difficult to follow, and Kelvin didn‚Äôt even realize when it looped the first time! After the very dramatic ending scene of the last loop, everyone reconvened at the gift shop, where Kelvin and Steven split a book to attempt to decipher the story and family tree, and Esha bought a cool retro poster. In the end, online guides to Sleep No More proved the most informative, and they wished they had read some spoiler-free ones before attending.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/9u9ivJAsRqCUyWHpA5mkPQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Esha and Kelvin got back together with Steven and Evelyn two weeks later to see The Music Man, starring Huge Jacked Man and Sutton Foster. They originally planned to eat at Ellen‚Äôs Stardust Diner, but despite arriving two hours before showtime, the line proved too formidable, and they didn‚Äôt want to rush either the dinner or musical experience. They instead decided to go to Urban Hawker, a nearby Singaporean food hall, where Esha and Kelvin got some fried rice, chicken, and boba. Everyone then made the short walk to the Winter Garden Theatre, and they settled into their (pretty nice) seats for the musical. Seeing Hugh Jackman up close was a surreal experience, and his charisma made every scene memorable, while his figure evoked Kelvin‚Äôs jealousy. Sutton was very cute too, and the two co-stars played off each other super well. Their antics had the crowd rolling in laughter, to the point that they broke character for a good few minutes as Hugh trolled Sutton with his impromptu dance moves. The story itself was quite heartwarming, and Benjamin Pajak playing Winthrop did a great job drawing people‚Äôs sympathy and spraying them with spit. Everyone had a fantastic time and cheered on the Broadway Cares charity drive after the show, as some well-off audience members bid past $4000 for Hugh Jackman‚Äôs gloves.</p>

<p>On the way home, Esha and Kelvin stopped at Grace Street for a matcha basque cheesecake and sunset lemonade to satisfy their sweet tooths.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/ZuNhtBouQ_GyHBBkJvWuFA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Sunday morning, Steven and Evelyn came over to Jersey side, and Kelvin drove everyone upstate to Blooming Hill Farm. While they decided what to order, Evelyn admired the plethora of plants and pointed out the breeds she recognized and grew at home, as the rest of the table dodged a bee that was equally interested. They started off with a pair of hot apple ciders, which were sugary enough that the bee promptly dive bombed into one. Luckily, Steven was granted another cup, and the rest of the meal passed much more peacefully. While Steven and Evelyn tried one of the pizzas, Esha opted for a giant beets &amp; greens salad and squash &amp; apple soup, and both couples got a fall hash, which was Kelvin‚Äôs favorite by far.</p>

<p>After trying their best but still ending up with tons of leftovers, they went to peruse the farmstand, where Esha bought a sweet smelling quince to make jam with later.</p>

<p>Next, they drove to Bear Mountain, which was many times more packed than Kelvin had ever seen it, so they knew that they had finally picked the right week to go. Indeed, the fall foliage was right at its peak, and the colors were totally eye-popping. They took a relaxing walk around the lake, breathing in the brisk autumn air and taking photo lessons from Esha. As usual, Kelvin was forced to model her numerous, and sometimes confusing, directions, but this time Steven was dragged into it as well.</p>

<p>At the end of the loop, they stopped by the gift store, and Kelvin managed to snag the last remaining ‚ÄúTrespassers Will Be Composted‚Äù sign to gift Vivian on their upcoming trip to Austin. They enjoyed a nice drive back to NJ accompanied by Taylor Swift‚Äôs Midnights, and Steven and Evelyn were able to make it to their vibraphone concert in Brooklyn on time.</p>

<p>A few days later, Kelvin‚Äôs dad flew into town to participate in the NY marathon. Esha and Kelvin picked him up from the airport and stopped by Honshu for dinner, before settling in to play with Blossom, see Bubbles embarrass herself for another man, and watch Enola Holmes 2 on Netflix.</p>

<p>The next morning, Dad left bright and early to tour lower Manhattan, where the marathon wouldn‚Äôt run, as Esha and Kelvin worked during the day (yes, playing with kibbies is hard work). For dinner, they went back to McKittrick Hotel, this time to meet up with PJ and eat at Gallow Green, the Instagrammable rooftop restaurant. As they enjoyed their Sleep No More and Dew Drop cock/mocktails, they caught up with PJ‚Äôs impromptu travels and always interesting love life. After they had finished their burgers and salad, Kelvin‚Äôs dad dropped in as well, having walked all the way down from Central Park, and they savored some panna cotta, ice cream, and key lime pie desserts before taking the old wooden elevator back down and heading home.</p>

<p>The next morning, Dad left bright and early to go to brunch with his running buddies - Esha and Kelvin had lunch plans of their own, though they woke up much later. With the help of the subway, they reached Spring Caf√© on time, just as all their friends arrived as well. Steven and Evelyn had already experienced the hype, but the vegan bento, noodles, and buns were very well received by Joel and Amanda.</p>

<p>Afterwards, everyone got boba from iMilky, then they walked towards SoHo, where the boys split off to visit FiDi while the girls started their shopping trip at Pol√®ne. As KeIvin, Steven, and Joel made their round-trip to the southern tip of Manhattan and back, laughing about IT and finance and watching a woman make her poor daughter touch The Bull‚Äôs balls, Esha was busy peer pressuring Evelyn and Amanda to buy a Herm√©s coat at The RealReal. She was ultimately successful in her endeavor, as Evelyn led the DPS race going into Gentle Monster. The boys met back up with them there, and Amanda put herself on the board with a pair of sunglasses. At this point, Esha was in the negatives due to her return at RealReal, but she wasn‚Äôt going to go down without a fight. They stopped at Zimmermann next, and the boyfriends became well acquainted with the couch as a nautical themed fashion show was put on for them. Esha fell in love with the unique patterns and styles produced by the brand, and they eventually walked out with her in a solid second place. They browsed a few more stores including Off-White and Toteme (Gottem), until it was time for Joel and Amanda to head back to get ready for their friend‚Äôs wedding. Esha and Kelvin ordered South Lions for dinner, and Dad brought back a ton of carbs to load up for the marathon. They watched a few episodes of The Last Dance before food coma-ing and calling it a night.</p>

<p>The next morning, Dad left bright and early to run! While he was making his way through the five boroughs, Esha and Kelvin had lunch at Thai Villa, which they found on a list of NYC‚Äôs prettiest restaurants. Though the decor was definitely top-notch, and the reservation difficult to book, the food was not quite as good as it looked, with the Royal Pad Thai being the best dish of the meal.</p>

<p>After lunch and a bit of Muji browsing, they headed up to Central Park to hang out at the marathon finish line. By watching the runners‚Äô app, they were able to tell when Dad neared the last corner, but they were made to wait a while as they saw him take his sweet time recording the city spectacle around him. When he finally heard their shouting and cheering, Dad was so excited and ran over to celebrate, ruining some poor racer‚Äôs time by asking for a picture with Esha and Kelvin. As he went on to finish the race and collect his medal, the two of them took a nice walk through Central Park, which was stunningly beautiful that day in peak foliage. Though it was quite an ordeal finding Dad again and making it to the subway, it was a worthwhile experience to see, and they were glad they took the opportunity to attend. On the final day of Dad‚Äôs trip, he left bright and early to drive to Princeton to meet some old college friends - the theme of this weekend was that he was way more popular than Esha and Kelvin could ever hope to be. On his return, he left them with a huge bag of Chinese veggies from his friend‚Äôs garden before they dropped him off at Newark Airport.</p>

<p>The Music Man set off an interesting chain of events, as Esha and Kelvin read that Sutton Foster had been in Gilmore Girls, so they rewatched A Year in the Life, in which she played an actress who had performed in the off-broadway musical Kinky Boots, which Kelvin learned was ending its current season at Stage 42, so they caught the last Friday showing on 11/18! Since it was a smaller theater, the show was very up close and personal, and though it started off a bit slow plot and music-wise, once Lola hit the stage everything transformed. Callum Francis was quintessential and carried the emotional experience, and the flash and humor of the production were eye-opening for Esha and Kelvin. After the last musical number, which had the whole theater hyped, standing up and clapping along, they were rather sad that it was over. Reflecting on the show, they went across the street to Ollie‚Äôs Sichuan, where the owners seemed happy to see some Asian customers, to grab a bite to eat while reviewing the history of Kinky Boots.</p>

<p>Satisfied with their dinner, they walked back towards the PATH station, happening to stumble upon the Bryant Park Winter Village that they had perused after Kelvin‚Äôs birthday at the beginning of the year. They took their time checking out a number of Christmas stores, and Esha ate her first whoopie pie! Having thoroughly explored the village and vowing to come for an actual meal sometime, they went home to rest.</p>

<p>The next day was JC Friendsgiving, hosted at their apartment. Esha made her famous green onion pancake and both a kale salad and mozzarella tomato salad. Kelvin prepared his muhammara and red cooked pork with bean curd and quail eggs. Boyu and Amy picked up Rohu fish from Korai Kitchen and Peking duck from Pinch Chinese, and brought their homemade silk squash soup and snow pea leaves too. Finally, Udaya and Snighda brought delicious apple and cherry pies and Pebble. Everyone had a fun evening talking about their holiday plans and Udaya‚Äôs imminent graduation, and playing some Coup. Esha and Kelvin‚Äôs cooking received a lot of compliments, which was something Kelvin never thought he would hear - his efforts this past year have bore some fruit!</p>
