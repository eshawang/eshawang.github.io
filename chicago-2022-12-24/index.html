<p>For the holidays this year, Esha and Kelvin planned to fly into Chicago for a week to meet up with Kelvin’s family, who they hadn’t seen in person together in quite a while. Unfortunately, Janet and Lindsay were visiting Paris at the same time, but they graciously allowed them to stay at their place, and Kelvin’s family booked an AirBnB nearby. The day of Christmas Eve, Esha and Kelvin went to NYC to procure some loaves of babka from Breads Bakery, which was all the rage on an r/FoodNYC thread, to give as gifts. Since it was nearby, they also booked a reservation at Pinto Garden, which was serving some very unique Thai fusion dishes on their brunch menu. Kelvin thoroughly enjoyed a crispy pork belly congee with garlic crisps, and Esha’s Sunrise Pad Thai complemented it well.</p>

<p>At the bakery, they almost bought a savory bialy babka, a special collab with Smitten Kitchen, but managed to find the original chocolate ones they were after. With three babkas in Esha’s Bembien bag (one for Janet and Lindsay, one for Wenqiu and Yiqiao, and one for themselves), they still wanted more bread and went across the street to the Union Square Winter Village at the sight of a Bread Alone Bakery stand. They browsed the lively shops and restaurant pop-ups before grabbing a loaf of San Francisco sourdough (Kelvin considered sending a picture of Esha’s new BFF to SourDohee). Esha then wanted to watch Avatar The Way of Water but was embarrassed to bring her friend into the theater, so they first dropped all their breads off at home. Until the 7pm showing, they shopped around Newport Mall for some jeans and black boots for Kelvin, not realizing that the food court closed when all the stores did. Their dinner thus sadly consisted of four leftover Panda Express egg rolls, but they made up the calories by getting a bag of popcorn at the theater. They both managed to stay awake and not pee throughout the whole 3 hour 12 minute movie, and though there were a few squint-worthy plot armor points, it was a fun and beautiful experience overall.</p>

<p>On Christmas day, they had a short get-together with Shir, Ahalya, and Ian at their apartment. Shir picked up food from Tasty Moment on his way from home, and Ahalya, who had just come back from her postdoc in Switzerland, drove with Ian down from his family’s place in Fort Lee. They had a really nice time catching up about Ahalya’s Europe experience and work woes, and hearing about Shir’s new gf. Kelvin baked one of the babkas they had acquired, and as Esha was serving it, he took a taste of a crumb left in the toaster oven. The chocolatey goodness was amazing even in that tiny morsel, and his reaction induced the rest of the room’s excitement. Indeed, as each person bit into their slice of that gooey but crunchy, delicious bread, they were blown away by the flavor and texture and insulted that this was their first time experiencing it. Esha and Kelvin did not have very many leftovers and were happy knowing that they were giving some good gifts this season.</p>

<p>After their friends headed out, and they finished the rest of their packing, they went to the airport early in case of snafus due to Winter Storm Elliott. Expecting a busy security check and lots of standby travelers from the canceled flights preceding them, they instead were treated to 4.5 hours of delays caused by crappy gate management. They managed to entertain themselves listening to passengers from other gates applaud sarcastically for flight boardings, and a random guy yelling down the terminal “Stop flying United they fucking suck!” Kelvin also bought a pizza and juice for them to eat while Esha learned how to play Chrono Ark, until finally they were able to get on a plane from a different gate and get on their way to Chicago. Kelvin’s joke that his family might arrive before they did almost came true, as they landed at ORD just 1.5 hours before the others’ flight from SFO.</p>

<p>Since their Getaround booking fell through, instead of driving up to Northwestern, everyone decided to get some food in their sleep-deprived bodies at Wildberry. The line was surprisingly short, and they enjoyed taking pictures of snowflakes in each other’s hair as they waited.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Rnatm72ISJ-Alhp_TIRXaA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/3HowtnEYRfKDDg7Stufghw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Once they were seated in their cozy corner booth, they excitedly ordered white + dark chocolate banana pancakes, chorizo eggs benedict, veggie hash skillet, and the turkey chili special with a side of fries.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/IMfzMRY0StiMB_oWxcPcHA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Everything was a hit, and it helped energize them greatly (or at least motivate them to burn off the calories), and they set off north on Michigan Ave to do some shopping. As they crossed the Chicago River into Magnificent Mile, everyone was quite impressed at the city’s Christmas decorations, and they really felt grateful to be spending the holiday time with each other.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/dduz41WNTxG65hBrN8auYA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Together, they browsed Nordstrom, still in search of black chukkas that Kelvin liked, Aesop, where Kelvin’s family tried a bunch of scented samples, skipped UGG with a line longer than Chanel (just why?), and Sephora, where Esha showed off her contouring skills on the Fang family noses. They also came across the largest Starbucks any of them had ever seen - four stories tall! Incredibly curious, they went in and toured the facility, which had coffee bars on the ground and 3rd floor, a bakery on the 2nd, and a cocktail bar on the 4th. There was even a roof terrace, which was covered in snow so unfortunately closed for the day.</p>

<p>After making their way back down, they decided to head back to Janet and Lindsay’s so that Kelvin’s family could check in to their AirBnB, and everyone could rest a bit before dinner. Esha and Kelvin spent their rest time trekking to Mariano’s and getting their obligatory half-gallon of freshly squeezed orange juice, now up to $6.99, and a watermelon juice as well. A glass of each later, they made their way to the green line, meeting back up with Kelvin’s family to go to Fulton Market District. They arrived early and, having some time to kill, went into Time Out Market, which Esha and Kelvin recognized from their trip to Chicago in June. Surprisingly, almost half of the restaurants seemed to be new, and after passing by each one, they all settled down on the second floor to wait until their reservation.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/uZz-i8nZTZ2gXkZe99DkVw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>When the time came, everyone excitedly walked over to Girl &amp; the Goat, where they were promptly seated. Despite the restaurant being completely packed, the service was great, and they started with drinks for Esha (you had me at aloe), Shirley (peach tea-quila), and Dad (riesling).</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Ld2RGtCvTRqFJKc8XtSGbA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>For food, everyone chipped in with suggestions and Yelp reviews, and they got pan fried shishito peppers, sautéed green beans, hamachi crudo, sautéed bay scallops, roasted pig face, sticky glazed pork shank, and goat empanadas to share. Although Esha had been slightly worried whether Kelvin’s family would enjoy the New American fare, she was quickly relieved to see that everyone loved the meal, with every dish eliciting wows, especially from Mom. They all had a fantastic time playing shishito pepper roulette and making pork shank wraps, while gatekeeping Kelvin’s diet. Everyone got to thoroughly enjoy their favorite dishes as they quite thoughtfully split the food according to their preferences. For Shirley’s birthday, they even got the green beans comp’ed and had a surprise coffee ice cream at the end to boot.</p>

<p>Though since Shirley herself was not a fan of coffee, they made the easy decision to go down the block for Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams for extra dessert. Esha and Mom were completely stuffed, but Kelvin, Shirley, and Dad split a scoop of wildberry lavender and salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks. Finally having eaten more than everyone’s fill, and quite sleepy from both travel and food coma, they all headed home to get some well deserved rest.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/bCu0DdsxSWWjE3jInetjjg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The next morning, everyone met at the AirBnB, and Esha and Kelvin just happened to bump into Shirley and Dad getting back from Dunkin’. They warmed up a bit inside with tea and donuts before setting out for Grant Park. At the Agora, everyone took turns copying the statues’ poses and taking silly pictures.</p>

<p>They walked over the pedestrian bridge to the Chicago marathon finish line, then continued north, sporadically hopping in the snow and watching Shirley make a snow angel. When they reached Buckingham Fountain, they crossed Lake Shore Dr to Queen’s Landing and got an awesome view of frozen Lake Michigan. The ice was just beginning to thaw, and they could hear cracking and moaning as they stood on the shore.</p>

<p>At that point, people started to get hungry, so everyone walked over to Revival Food Hall to grab lunch. Esha didn’t want to make decisions, so she volunteered for table guard duty, as Kelvin browsed through the numerous options. A few minutes later, he brought back an Ayam Rica Rica from Minhasa and a mushroom broth with roast garlic broth bomb. Shirley and Dad opted for empanadas and a chicken tortilla soup, and Kelvin also helped Mom find a warm noodle soup (Soto Ayam) to eat. The Indonesian fried chicken in the Rica Rica was a bit spicy and sour, so to help balance out the flavors, he went back to Electric Greens and got a Hemp Seed Crunch Toast.</p>

<p>Having eaten a bit more than they intended, they eagerly got ready to continue on with their itinerary, only to find out that the Art Institute was closed. They decided to shuffle their plans a bit and visit Navy Pier that afternoon instead, but first they stopped by the CBOT, which was nicely decorated with Christmas wreaths and ornaments.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/6vLuu9eEQ0imaij85MLV0w?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>When they reached Navy Pier, they discovered there was a Light Up the Lake festival happening. The designs were pretty lit, with some large installations like a rubber ducky, deer, and teddy bear. Kelvin was annoying and got in the way of many photos, but then thankfully got distracted by the memory cube game. Without really trying, he got 7th on the leaderboard and signed his name as Fro, only to discover that 5th place was held by Ko, which seemed good enough for him.</p>

<p>After making their way around the festival hall, they got in line to rent ice skates, but the rink closed for cleaning, so, not wanting to miss their dinner reservation, they moved on to the ferris wheel. While the line for the elevator looked a bit scary, it was not too long before they found themselves high up above the pier, and everyone got some great shots of the city lights and skyline. Upon looking down, Esha was also reminded of the Crystal Gardens, but she was disappointed to see that it was closed for renovation too.</p>

<p>Everyone browsed the stores a bit after the ride, and then they took a bus to Avec. With all of the small annoyances of the day, they were pleased to find out that wine bottles were half off for Tuesday, and they ordered a Lise et Bertrand Jousset sparkling wine. They were even given a few glasses for free as the bottle was chilled!</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/SdIlQ7ZySe6ghAW90voN7w?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>For small plates, they got the charred cabbage, wild Mexican prawns, chorizo-stuffed Medjool dates, and hummus with baby carrots. The dates and prawns were highlights of the whole meal, and they refused the server trying to take the remaining sauce away, asking instead for an extra pita to wipe it up with. They ordered rotisserie chicken shawarma and Persian rice pilaf with lamb shoulder as mains, and they loved the garlic toum sauce, though they were shocked to discover another giant pita covering the pilaf, which they struggled to finish. Ultimately, Kelvin’s family took some leftovers home since they had already run Janet and Lindsay’s fridge out of space with babka and juice, and everyone went to bed with full stomachs and tentative plans to jog in the Chicago winter morning like crazy people.</p>

<p>Kelvin woke up grumpy and sleep-deprived at Esha’s 7:30am alarm and begrudgingly got dressed for his least favorite form of exercise. They met up with Dad at the AirBnB and started their jog towards Grant Park. Esha’s natural talent and lighter frame allowed her to pull ahead of Kelvin, but he kept his grit and tried his best to keep up with her and Dad. Seeing his effort, they patiently took breaks to let him catch up. Though it was painful, the scenery of the morning sun over the lakefront made the run more bearable, and the view from the still icy pier was quite breathtaking (or maybe that was just their lungs dying).</p>

<p>On the return trip, Dad taught Esha and Kelvin about good running habits, and Kelvin experimented with some breathing techniques and mental imagery which seemed to help. However, by the time they reached the AirBnB, his legs were dead tired, so they all went up to rest a while and let Kelvin get a drink and donut. After Esha and Kelvin showered and changed, they met back up with Kelvin’s family to walk around Millenium Park. When they had taken enough basic photos and selfies, everyone walked over to nearby Garrett’s to buy some popcorn to tide them over until dinner (no lunch allowed before Oriole). Kelvin’s family really enjoyed the cheese and sweet caramel mix, especially Mom, who kept munching all the way to Museum Campus.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, they found that Shedd Aquarium was out of tickets until late afternoon, and Field Museum’s line was too long. They instead took a walk around the campus by the lake and were surprised to find that nearly all the ice had thawed on that side.</p>

<p>Since everyone was a bit tired, they decided to go back home early to rest a bit before getting ready for dinner - Esha enjoyed a nice nap while Kelvin worked on this blog. An hour or two before their reservation time, Esha woke up and did makeup with Mom and Shirley. A bit later, the guys also got dressed, and Kelvin the Human Alarm Clock had to yell at Dad to wear something better than sneakers to Oriole - luckily, Kelvin’s boots fit his outfit pretty well, so he was able to repay the favor of borrowing Dad’s running shoes. With everyone looking quite classy, they booked an Uber and arrived just on time, though for the second time their driver was worried about the shady af drop-off location. After reassuring him that the dark back alley was indeed the right spot, they entered Oriole and came up to the familiar freight elevator/garage door. Kelvin’s family enjoyed the spectacle of the industrial waiting room opening into refined Michelin restaurant, as they were greeted by their server and had their coats taken. Their server was happy to hear that Esha and Kelvin had dined at Oriole before, and even happier to show them all the renovations it had undergone since they had last been there. While the restaurant had a cozier vibe with brick walls back in 2018, the new Oriole had a sleeker design, yet still emanated warmth with a number of fireplaces and comfortable seats. They had also significantly expanded their floorplan, and everyone was first led to the new bar area for preliminary drinks and appetizers.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/q3VTp7D2QdCTs_HPjlDjxg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Right away, Kelvin’s family was blown away by the drink pairings - the spirit-free Fresh and the Sparkling Sake that even Kelvin actively enjoyed - so much so that they forgot the pairing part and downed them before the arrival of the first food course. Mom also got overly excited and went behind the bar to take pictures of everyone with their drinks and got reprimanded by Kelvin, though the bartenders were very nice about it and even refilled their glasses. Everyone was thus able to fully enjoy the first pairing with the Sea Urchin, Carabineros, and Hiramasa, a beautiful set of three seafood small bites. The Sea Urchin started the meal off with unparalleled smoothness, while the meatier Carabineros with sauce américaine delivered the first deep punch of flavor, and the Hiramasa served to cleanse the palette and keep the appetizer portion light and anticipatory.</p>

<p>For the second course, everyone was led to an island in front of the open kitchen, where the chefs were busy preparing entrées for the night. Both Rosé pairings were introduced as drinks with complex layers to accentuate the multidimensional, and absolutely gorgeous, Foie Gras. The huckleberries on top added sweetness to the savory paté and perfectly baked bread, and gold flakes found their way onto everybody’s lips, which also matched beautifully with Esha’s Zimmermann top.</p>

<p>After that stunning combination of flavors and colors, they were taken to their main table and introduced to most people’s favorite spirit, the Riesling Spätlese, and the Odayaka. A Spiny Lobster with matching coconut and honeydew froth that was reminiscent of Kelvin’s previous favorite dish, Pike, was brought out.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/D1_wZcsTR2ScPEJHilzlDQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>At this point, the drinks began to build up, and the chain of bathroom goers started, with Esha first confirming the upgrades to those facilities as well, which included Aesop hand soap, mouthwash, and lotion. An outright umami bomb was next on the table, a cup of Matsutake soup filled with black truffle pieces and tarragon leaves. Kelvin’s favorite drink of the meal, the Toasty genmaicha, and another Sake from Miyagi were extraordinarily relaxing and perfect for balancing out the strong flavors.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/PCvgkqCYQomgEH1oG_Uq3Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>For the next two courses, everyone was given a bit of seaweed butter and a bread roll for soaking up leftover sauce, a perk that seemed perfectly catered for Esha.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/RfVD4VcxQnqC5PNjtID9Pg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>A Meursault white wine and spirit-free Bianco, which was cool and refreshing with more subtle fennel, accompanied the Sablefish. Kelvin’s parents got their first taste of caviar, and the oyster sauce was very fresh and intriguing.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/3HtR_8H5QAWi3_dKM7pdMw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The second to last savory course was one that Esha and Kelvin were super familiar with - the Capellini pasta, an Oriole special that was Esha’s first experience with truffle in 2018! Their anticipation while the server introduced the dish was palpable, and it turned out to be even better than they remembered, due to the new addition of crispy fried capers. The rest of Kelvin’s family thoroughly enjoyed the immense truffle flavor and perfectly cooked pasta in conjunction with the Barbaresco from Italy and chrysanthemum-infused Malty.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/buldHaHoSC2JoSekmCDZXw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>After everyone had meticulously scooped up every drop of sauce, a Saint-Julien red wine and Evocative shiitake consommé were presented, indicating the apex of the chef’s tasting experience. The climax of the meal was an absolutely delectable cut of Miyazaki Beef, served with a dollop of hakurei turnip pureé and roasted little gem lettuce. On top of each piece of beef the server also grated a bit of real wasabi root, which was so fresh and light, with none of the sting from horseradish. The meat, along with a small cup of seasoned broth, had no hint of earthiness, and both Esha and Kelvin’s mom found it totally delicious (everybody else was a given). They all agreed that it was the best beef entrée they had ever tasted and craved more despite being completely stuffed at that point.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/j3OH1xrLS_KM5yiux9KKKA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>With the main courses sadly over, everyone was served a Peach three-ways palette cleanser, which turned out to be one of the most fun dishes of the night. The flavors were surprisingly complex, with an initial burst of sweetness akin to haw flakes that gave way to a lighter fizziness due to the Tasmanian pepperberries.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/G8RXUcTITnOCIDrLk9F0LA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>This transitioned into the dessert courses nicely, though to the girls’ distress, the first one was a heavier Soufflé with hot cream. Kelvin had (got) to help Esha finish the sauce in the middle, but the pastry part was too delicious to give up, especially paired with Crisp and Pear Ciders.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/9Rb8ewgHQBuMkoWZ_K7ssw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>The final course was a spicy one, a beautiful Mont Blanc soybean tart with ginger Zesty drink and Vin Santo del Chianti Classico spirit.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/7qM2YlhcSFK2TIB_i9jaFQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>And to wrap it all up, each person got their choice of tea, as well as two Bon-Bons with cute designs, though Kelvin was the only one who didn’t have to take those home.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/cvx7ekoQRtmqWL5zOs6-JA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Finally having reached the end of their 3.5 hour long meal, everyone was beyond satisfied and in need of some serious focused digestion. Esha and Kelvin reiterated to their server that after five years Oriole still remained the best dining experience ever, and Kelvin’s family was extremely pleased at their first Michelin 2 star tasting menu. Everyone went home very determined to not get up for running the next day.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FzMuvpoCT8mGi6J0qY9h0g?viewBox=1161%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>After a very good night’s sleep, during which Kelvin dreamed of the Miyazaki Beef, everyone got back together at Cai in Chinatown for lunch. They kept the dim sum order fairly light, then went to Joy Yee for some dragon passionfruit and honeydew smoothies.</p>

<p>Everyone made their way around Chinatown Square Plaza posing with the zodiac statues and laughing at the (in)accuracies of the fortunes. From there, they walked to Ping Tom Memorial Park and took some photos at the pagoda by the river and of the murals under the 18th St bridge.</p>

<p>Shirley craved some baked goods, so their last stop before heading to the red line station was Chiu Quon, where they bought some wintermelon cakes, a bbq pork bun, and a red bean paste cake.</p>

<p>Back in River North, everyone tried their hands at Special Ops: Mysterious Market at The Escape Game Chicago. The five of them were paired with another couple and led into the game room, where Esha and Kelvin did some good work solving puzzles with canes, lights, and shoes. Dad managed to skip a step entirely to help unlock the door to the next room, then almost led everyone straight out the (false) exit. The group did less well on the second half, as there were some struggles with the flashy military screen and refueling minigame. Unfortunately, they ran out of time with two steps left to solve, though Kelvin was confident that they could have finished with just a few more minutes.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Wu94iu1XTBS8bjx4oxnuVw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>At that point, Esha and Kelvin had a dinner date with Erin, so they split off for The Cheesecake Factory while Kelvin’s family went to try Al’s Beef. The restaurant was just as Esha remembered it from her teenage years, and they had a nice time reminiscing about the last decade over their avocado egg rolls and surprisingly flavorful skinnylicious entrées.</p>

<p>After dinner, they hopped back on the red line to Wrigley Field, where the last Christkindlmarket of the season was thankfully still being hosted. With Kelvin’s family, they roamed through the winter village’s shops and food stalls, picking up the 2023 Christmas mug and some wafer snacks. When they had finished making their rounds, they all went back to the AirBnB to chill and munch on the day’s goodies before heading to bed.</p>

<p>Friday lunch was at Lou Malnati’s on Michigan Ave, where everyone shared two pies, The “Lou” with sausage and a custom thin crust with spinach mix and roma tomatoes. Kelvin’s family really enjoyed the deep dish pizza and easily demolished it in their rush to make it to their tour on time.</p>

<p>At 1 pm, they arrived at the Chicago Architecture Center for A Walk Through Time, led by their guide Cynthia. The tour started along the river with Trump Tower and two examples of mid-century modernism, AMA/IBM Plaza and Marina City aka the Corncob Towers.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FIFKzIYnS9iGXfXf31iwuQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>From there, they wrapped around State St to the Page Brothers Building, which featured Chicago’s last remaining cast iron front, and the Chicago Theater and ABC7 street studio, some of the first steel-framed skyscrapers.</p>

<p>Cynthia then took them into the Chicago Motor Club Building, which featured a large map of U.S. highway routes in the lobby, and the Carbide and Carbon Building, a completely over-the-top exemplification of the art deco style. Along with the prevalence of octagons, they learned about height restrictions imposed after the fire that led to many buildings sporting narrower towers above the 22nd floor.</p>

<p>Crossing back over the river, they passed by the glass Apple store, then visited the Tribune Tower, which Esha liked due to its interesting Gothic design and wondered about its rent.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/uLl8XUgJTgOJI5uk14ge_Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Behind it stood the giant NBC Tower, a postmodern building that somewhat mirrored the Rockefeller Center in NYC and also held UChicago’s Booth School of Business.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/-KYWnPDORq6mfLxDW09eaQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>Finally, the group got a good look at The St. Regis Chicago, developed by Jeanne Gang, and learned about its interesting and award-winning design. The shading of the glass on the undulating frustums reduced heat in the building (as well as preventing bird kamikazes), and the hollow section that everyone had wondered about provided stability by dampening wind-induced oscillations.</p>

<p><img src="https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/bTWHQHliRFOkqKFr7Bm5ig?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd" alt="image" /></p>

<p>At the end of their tour, Cynthia asked everyone’s favorite architectural style, which Esha and Kelvin answered with postmodernism and MCM, respectively (very in character), and Kelvin also offered “New Millenia” to replace the current Contemporary style naming. They thanked their guide for the wonderfully informative excursion and continued on to The Art Institute to complete the trifecta of Esha’s high school trip activities.</p>

<p>At the museum, they browsed the Photography exhibit and Thorne Miniature Room, then walked through the Arts of Ancient Egypt and Asia until they reached the special exhibitions.</p>

<p>On the second floor, there was a series of digital iPad drawings titled The Arrival of Spring set in Normandy by David Hockney, which culminated in two hand-animated pieces that they found pretty neat. Above that, Esha and Kelvin passed by the Picasso paintings and various abstract sculptures of weird body parts and Amongus.</p>

<p>After sitting for a bit and admiring the view of Millenium Park, they were wished a Healthy Happy 2023 as they left for Garrett’s round 2 and dinner.</p>

<p>Shirley and Mom picked up a few tins of popcorn to bring back to California, and Esha spotted a special holiday flavor - hot cocoa caramel mix - that they had missed the first time, before they sat down at The Purple Pig for their last big meal of the vacation. Their waiter was very persuasive in suggesting dishes, and they excitedly ordered the bone marrow, pig tongue, pork shoulder, grilled broccoli, crispy pig ear, and mussels. The bone marrow was a crowd favorite as expected, and the pig tongue and shoulder were also super delicious with their contrasting textures and flavors.</p>

<p>After the food was all cleaned up, everyone took a nice walk down Magnificent Mile until they reached John Hancock Tower, where they took the elevator up to the Signature Lounge on the 96th floor. Kelvin’s family was wowed by the view, and they all celebrated a fun holiday together with a bottle of champagne and a couple cocktails. There was much meaningful conversation and happy emotions, and they talked well through the evening to closing time, until eventually everyone went home to pass out.</p>

<p>Kelvin must have gotten drunk somehow since he woke up early on the last day to go running by himself. After taking some selfies by Monroe Harbor, he returned to the AirBnB to see his family off.</p>

<p>When they had gotten on the bus to the airport, he and Esha headed to Chinatown for a quick lunch of rou jia mo, liang pi, and dumplings from Shan Shaan.</p>

<p>They chilled for a bit at Kung Fu Tea with boba and popcorn chicken, and soon enough it was time to head to the airport themselves. Their flight back was not quite as delayed, and though they missed the fireworks flying in, they enjoyed celebrating the New Year with the bus crowd, and some relaxed home cooking and kitty cuddles the next day.</p>
