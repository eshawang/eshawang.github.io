&lt;p&gt;E started her month long funemployment with a trip to Banff and to visit Alm and Petite who lived nearby. It was E’s first international trip since the pandemic started, and the flight was out of JFK, so E allocated plenty of time to get to the airport and to the gate. Luckily, there were no major issues! The view from the AirTrain was actually quite nice, despite it costing a hefty $8 each way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/ECmBDy5CRnSFFZiug8ypHg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E read several chapters of TGCF and took a short nap, which made the flight go by rather quickly. A few hours later, E landed at Calgary airport, where she was greeted by Alm and Petite. Afterwards, we drove to Red Deer (the Texas of Canada, as they call it), which was about an hour and a half drive away. Even though E landed at around 9pm Alberta time, the sun had barely begun to set, and we got a beautiful view of the horizon on the way to Alm and Petite’s apartment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we arrived at Red Deer, Alm and Petite warned E that Loki was a blabbermouth and mini Maeve was a feisty girl. E came prepared with Churu though. Loki instantly darted for the treats, while Maeve hesitated at first, but eventually gave in. That night, it seemed like both cats warmed up to E, since this is what she woke up to after losing the feeling in her legs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/7AFwEEurQ1m3L46fuGctoQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we woke up early to drive through Banff and north all the way to the Columbia Icefields, where we got to see the Athabasca Glaciers. We got the 11am off-peak tickets, which, to get to the viewpoint, consisted of riding a bus with some legit looking wheels through a steep and unpaved path. While the view was gorgeous, the glaciers were barely visible and significantly smaller than they were ten years ago (according to K), and E inevitably thought about humankind’s impending doom due to global warming. At this point, the only hint of the glaciers was a slight blue tint in the valleys between the mountains, and one had to squint to be able to see them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/rsEVB3nUQ--unP634QSN8g?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FFc6F2voSWCUAC7biqBLzA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KV9t6KrjRbiJpo0OIgoshA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Icefield Adventure also included tickets for the skywalk, which was a glass bridge overlooking part of the mountain range in Jasper. On the way, E took more photos and even saw a couple of mountain goats!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/4CI8fH5CSj6FokMx1GK74g?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It turns out Alm and Petite were both afraid of heights (mostly Alm), and had to muster some courage to walk over the glass bridge. E asked if they had seen Squid Game, and it was probably a good thing that they hadn’t.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/sN_4ulfuTM2UdKV5vOh2Ag?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Iuykf7obQcOzk80aNbQnzA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we stopped by a gift shop where E tried on a kid-sized hat in the shape of a bear (why don’t they make these for adults?) and examined some dreamcatchers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/vO7xkb9HSj-9LBPyfIil0Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/ghbplv_GS_23to4UqhInPg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Food at the Icefield was overpriced and looked not particularly great, so we drove south instead to do some sightseeing. Unfortunately, Saskatchewan Crossing appeared to be completely frozen over, but we were able to do the short hike up to Sunwapta Falls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/ray2miyLQ9-h7Z9LQqVciQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to the Airbnb, we went to Boston Pizza for dinner, which is also where Petite previously worked as a waitress. However, Boston isn’t exactly known for pizza and this was in Canmore of all places, so E’s intuition wasn’t wrong. We ended up getting 2-for-3 appetizers and a large pizza, which we did a pretty good job with, considering we hadn’t eaten the entire day!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/56HhGE4tT36IaAqlA1-wNA?viewBox=1142%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, we woke up before sunrise to get in some golden hour photos for Alm and Petite, but it ended up being overcast anyway, so it didn’t actually matter. However, E did get some nice shots of moose. We first stopped by Lake Louise, but as with everything else, it was completely frozen over. Emerald Lake was only frozen over on one side, and we observed some duck jealousy and drama on the other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/rQV86KCKTRirtnOinfEl6Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/6YNFJniNRlGk0vHjcLrCGQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/nqVCXGDnS3a2Ljoj4D2J8Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we did a short but very slippery hike down Johnston Canyon, where there was a cave leading to a medium-sized waterfall. It was particularly crowded since University of Calgary students were apparently taking a field trip that day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/exFrQiW7SSmGYUVe4g6Rfg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FuU1fGDvRMmh4dTJYGlIxw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/D5wffgydR8yZZ_Nd15vqRg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/YqDgpZD2QTClX_fKPVGnyg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After our hike, we drove over to the Banff Upper Hot Spring to relax and recuperate our minimally mobile bodies. The hot spring itself actually looked more like a pool, and was crowded with people of all ages, including a teenage boy dressed in a bikini.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/xjS2-H_QTk-QmadM1pyp5Q?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For lunch, we drove to downtown Banff, and E took Alm and Petite to their first ever “legit” ramen place. All things considered, it was actually pretty good by E’s standards. For sure better than Shitsengumi! We also stopped by a gift shop that sold Rocky Mountain air (for only 15CAD!!!) and a “Chicago-style” popcorn shop which was literally just a Garrett’s knockoff.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/4K0MVgaFQB-LIbxvq5hUJw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KeBpnV4zSCu2Y7oOpnME1g?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that evening, we rode the Banff Gondola up what felt like one of the highest peaks in Banff. Since this was around sunset, the view was absolutely gorgeous. At first, E wasn’t sure the Banff Gondola was worth the cost, but this experience definitely made her reconsider.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/t3e-lrf1TgaQ5Riie494QQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, we decided to sleep in for once. For lunch, we drove back to downtown Banff, and E took Alm and Petite to their first Cajun experience! E and Alm both ordered a gumbo and jambalaya mix, while Petite ordered just the jambalaya. E also got some fried green tomatoes to share.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/RrcLHP5mRjW8pcUlFVLq4Q?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The rest of the day was spent mostly in the car, stopping at various places for sightseeing. We stopped by Lake Minnewanka, where Alm tried to go for a swim and regretted it immediately.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/QcllHJVAQ6GyqDte8khJMA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/GP4hGKizROKkEnfHtUBgZA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/PLEnFU1FRH6F9xH7_MWPkQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/bFGZ1YikRjq-28PHtzp5CQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E’s favorite part of the day was Sundance Canyon trail, which was about 3 miles each way. The trail started off very flat, but rounded into a forest and then a canyon with a waterfall near the end. The backlight from the sun was perfect for portrait photography, so E snapped a few shots of Alm and Petite, including ones of them slapping each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/-6V7BjnqR36ec4TegIRpqQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The following day was E’s final full day in Canada, but since we needed to check out of the Airbnb in the morning and therefore lost access to the park pass (plus Alm and Petite were tired from yesterday’s strenuous hike), we decided to just drive back to Red Deer. We made a quick stop in Calgary for lunch, where E took Alm and Petite to their first actual JBBQ (not garlic potatoes) at Gyu-Kaku. E later found out that Calgary is apparently known for very good Taiwanese food, which E is resolved to try next time! For dinner, to save on costs, we went to the grocery store in Red Deer to buy some ingredients. E made some broccolini and her signature green onion pancake while Petite made chicken tenders. Though not exactly what E expected as a final meal, everything turned out to be quite delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/7cgNIAcYQJCX8LH5sKqCbw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, E said goodbye to the kitties, and Alm and Petite drove E back to the airport. We said our goodbyes, and E encouraged them to visit NYC if they ever got a chance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday night, E and K took the long flight from the east coast to LAX. K mostly slept along the way, while E stayed up to study for an interview coming up the following week. When we finally landed, and following an unfortunate series of circumstances, such as the shuttle taking forever, getting the rental car line moving at a snail’s pace, and technical difficulties that delayed us leaving with the rental car, we arrived at Seorim and Daniel’s home at around 1:30am California time. By that time, E felt like a zombie, and promptly passed out and fell into a deep slumber.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, E had to wake up early for Phoebe’s bachelorette party. K offered to drop off E and Dohee at the party, so Dohee stopped by where we were staying first. The bachelorette party was located at a park in San Pedro, and after another one of E’s “where is my phone” incidents, E and Dohee successfully met up with Lydia and Johanna and settled on a location for the picnic and backdrop. Danielle and Vivian joined us soon after, who helped out with constructing the backdrop and blowing up NSFW balloons. Lydia taught E how to set up a charcuterie board, which ended up looking both colorful and delicious. All too soon, Phoebe arrived with Charlotte before we completed setting up, and in true Phoebe fashion, she asked how she could help out. The rest of us were very insistent that she just go take a walk, but we ended up just talking and catching up a bit, since it had been a while since Phoebe had seen some of us.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After setting up the picnic area, we all had a delicious meal consisting of cheese, crackers, Godiva, and champagne. Vivian told us about her brave little two year old, Danielle talked about work, New York, and some drama about one of her old friends, E talked about not wanting to move to Austin, while poor Charlotte had to be around suggestive balloons about her brother. Lydia planned a few games, such as guessing Leon’s answer to specific questions. For another one, we each wrote down our favorite memory with Phoebe, and she had to guess who wrote it. E’s was fairly obvious, since “where is my phone” incidents can easily be extended to “where is literally anything, including a borrowed bracelet” incidents. After that, it was time for Phoebe to open gifts! She got several pieces of lingerie, some workout clothes, and an Aesop gift set. E gifted a picture frame from MUJI, along with some of the engagement photos she edited and printed out. Afterwards, E set up a self timer on her DSLR, and we had everyone stand in front of the backdrop to take pictures. We started off with the bride-to-be with each of the girls doing silly poses and making jokes. E attempted her best to do what photographers are supposed to do best, which is make their subjects comfortable and get them talking, making for some of the best candid shots. Phoebe and Lydia make the cutest sister pair. We also got a shot with everyone at the end, and props to Vivian for the carry (literally).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since Phoebe and Lydia had a family dinner to attend in the evening, we only had about two hours to head over and enjoy a nearby Korean spa. E had never been to one before, but she tried to act cool about it, and thinks she pulled it off pretty well! Since we did not have too much time to spare, we just sat around and talked in the hot tubs, but next time, E definitely wants to get a full body scrub. E, Dohee, and Danielle had a nice talk about moving, career, and relationships, which was refreshing since E felt like we all share a similar outlook, despite not having kept in touch all that well recently. After the hot tub was starting to get a bit too steamy, we went to the food court area to order some lunch. E got a salmon teriyaki, which looked like the least carb option. Dohee and Danielle both ordered a cold soba noodle, which looked great as well. Phoebe and Lydia laughed and talked about their family dynamic, recalling stories of their parents being the textbook definition of loyalist, their uncle who really likes having meals with them, and Phoebe and Leon’s trip across Asia seeing both sides of the family and seeing all the sights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon after, it was time to part ways. Phoebe dropped off E and Dohee and their hotel in Torrance (thanks Jonathan), which was located at a convenient location right across from the mall. Dohee needed to get some complexion products, and E was excited to offer her VIB Rouge discount. Dohee ended up getting a Rare Beauty concealer and E got the NEST Seville Orange perfume oil that she had been eyeing for a while. We also stopped by a Mitsuwa, where E bought some mochi donuts and Fugetsu-do. Dohee ordered a mozzarella dog from Oh K-Dog, which E had a bite of and was quite tasty. E also ordered the new Teaspoon guava drink called Guava Sunset, which is described as a fresh blended guava and pineapple marmalade with a splash of lemon juice. Probably one of E’s favorite drinks from Teaspoon thus far! We also stopped by a lululemon, which E found to be as overpriced as she originally thought. After our short mall excursion, we went back to the hotel to relax for the rest of the night. Dohee asked E if there was anything she wanted to watch on the TV, and E shamelessly took the opportunity to introduce her to Heaven Official’s Blessing on Netflix. Mama Maeve would be so proud. With a face mask and lip mask, E and Dohee watched all the way until the end of the ghost bridegroom arc before E was ready to pass out before the wedding tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E and Dohee woke up early to get ready for the big day, but after our morning routine of Starbucks, doing our makeup and hair, and changing into our bridesmaid dresses, we ended up having to rush to our Uber to get to the venue. Luckily, we still got there with plenty of time to spare before the dress rehearsal. When we arrived, we said hello to Leon and Phoebe’s dad, and all the bridesmaids hung out for a bit in the bridesmaids room while K and Andrew went on a little joy ride in the latter’s rental Porsche. The dress rehearsal itself was relatively straightforward. Despite it being LA, the morning air was brisk and slightly chilly. E was paired with one of Leon’s groomsmen, and also in classic E manner, did not make a point to remember his name or anything else about him. Afterwards, Phoebe, Lydia, and their mom arrived from their professional hair and makeup session. Phoebe changed into her chicken cutlets and wedding dress, and the photographer took a variety of cute and silly pictures, including nostril flaring, farts, and a recreation of a scene from The Ring. The photographer was quite receptive to all of Phoebe’s (and E’s) crazy ideas, and we all had a pretty good laugh about it. After eating some tasty hors d’oeuvres, the guests were all seated, and we were ready to start the ceremony. Lydia walked first, followed by Johanna and then E. When E walked to the front, she saw that poor Leon was already sobbing, his eyes beet red. Seeing all the guests in one spot, E observed that the wedding was actually fairly small. It gave off a very intimate and familial feeling, which E appreciated. After the bridesmaids and groomsmen were in place, the guests all stood as Phoebe and her parents walked down the aisle. The ceremony itself was rather short, officiated by none other than Phoebe’s dad. We all had a good laugh when he accidentally called Leon by Lydia’s husband’s name instead. Phoebe and Leon then exchanged vows, with Leon’s vow starting off with “I am not a smart man”, as all good speeches do. Jokes were made and tears were shed, but all too soon, the ceremony was over. E and Dohee helped decorate the wedding cake from the altar flower arrangement while Phoebe and Leon went to take some more pictures with their photographer. Afterwards, the bridal party gathered to prepare an entrance and a little dance before lunch. To E’s horror, she and her partner were to go first. E ended up flailing her arms and spinning in circles, but managed to make it to her seat without being too much of an embarrassment. Lunch consisted of salad, truffle mac and cheese, pizza, steak, and desserts, which were quite delicious. After our meal, people started to slowly gather in the middle for some midday drinking and dancing. One of the guests had a little boy who was killing it on the dance floor, and he was definitely living for the attention xD. At some point, Andrew let K borrow the keys to his rental Porsche, and E and K ended up going for a short ride around the area. Eventually the reception came to an end and it was time to part ways. E and K first dropped off Dohee at her friend’s place and then drove back to Seorim’s house where they took a much needed nap. Later that evening, Natalie came over and we got Thai food for takeout. The restaurant had a pork belly pad thai was particularly delicious. Over dinner, we talked about horror movies, bees, and Natalie’s driving awareness, almost all in the form of Seorim and Daniel’s bickering. Eventually E and K couldn’t take it anymore and food coma’d to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, E and K set out for their old stomping grounds, the 626. We drove from Inglewood to Arcadia, which took a little under an hour, to get lunch at the long-awaited Dumpling House. The ordering was quick and ambitious, and we were soon greeted with a table spread of two orders of pork, shrimp, and chives dumplings, two pork rolls, a string bean with black bean sauce, and a cold pork belly in garlic chili oil. We belabored the secret behind making such delicious dumplings while thoroughly enjoying every bite, and still couldn’t figure out how the texture and pork flavor were done so perfectly. The side dishes of string bean and pork belly were also great in their own right, and we both found the cut of pork to be better than what we had at Szechuan Mountain House. Unfortunately, K pushed E a little too hard in finishing all the dumplings, so we took the pork rolls to go back home. Even then, E groaned and stumbled in pain all the way down the three blocks to Half &amp;amp; Half Tea Express. From Half &amp;amp; Half we ordered K’s default ice milk drink with all the toppings, a lavender milk tea for E, and an ice milk drink and normal milk tea for Seorim and Daniel. There was some confusion as to which drink was whose when we got them since they were unlabeled, but luckily K guessed the right ones. With boba in hand, we headed to Tech for a short walk down memory lane. We parked on San Pasqual and went down the Olive Walk, up by the Turtle Pond, and sat on the bridge in front of the library for a while. We noticed a lot of younger-than-usual students walking around and discovered that it happened to be Prefrosh Weekend for the class of 2025 &lt;em&gt;shudder&lt;/em&gt;. Continuing on, we passed by the Wedding Cake, Moore, Annenberg, Avery, and Sloan, and then turned up the street to see a new AWS quantum computing building that looked very swanky. After our short tour, we went back to Inglewood to drop off the boba orders and say goodbye to Seorim and Daniel, then we headed to a beer garden called Father’s Office to get dinner with Phoebe, Dohee, and Danielle and Andrew (and Cici!) before we flew out. E got carded for the first time in a while, but then we enjoyed a nice night of catching up on everyone’s careers and travels, and of course congratulating Phoebe on her wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K went to the Bronx to visit the New York Botanical Garden and see The Orchid Show: Jeff Leatham’s Kaleidoscope. The morning drive was relatively easy as we crossed the George Washington Bridge for the first time. We started our visit walking through the Perennial Garden, which had several distinct “rooms” separated by yew hedges. They formed the forefront of the main attraction, the Haupt Conservatory. Stepping into the building, we were met with a sharp increase in humidity, turning E into an orchid, and the insta-worthy kaleidoscope art installment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/QM4D0pDESqGETUAncDtZaQ?viewBox=1122%2C749&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout the rest of the conservatory, there were orchids and other plants from all kinds of biomes. K liked the ones that resembled Spanish dresses, and E found the upside-down hanging orchids amusing. There were also vines of thin vanilla seed pods and micro orchid clusters that looked like viruses. Between the rainforest and desert biomes, we walked through a rainbow tunnel that reminded us of Mario Kart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/mDehaWUdTHyYS_YLke0k8w?viewBox=692%2C923&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After doing our (first) round through the conservatory, we went to Hudson Garden Grill for a relaxing lunch. We managed to beat the large lunch crowd and get a seat at a two person high-top table. E asked K to pick a cocktail for her, and he unknowingly ordered the one with three alcoholic ingredients, starting the meal off with a bang. We got a sunchoke soup to share, which included caramelized apples and hazelnuts, then E ordered the Senat Farms chicken breast, which was rotisserie-level juicy with perfectly crispy skin, and K the braised lamb ragu with mushrooms. For dessert, we ordered a lemongrass panna cotta that had a delicious ginger-basil syrup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we headed over to the Mertz Library, which was surrounded by a Daffodil Valley beginning to bloom. We watched one particularly round squirrel sniff its way through the field as we hiked along the trail and into the Thain Family Forest. After a while we rounded back to the conservatory again to sit in on an orchid care class, where we learned about epiphytic versus terrestrial plants and received some tips on improving humidity conditions for Buttercup back home. We were also able to help another cat + orchid owner to prevent teeth marks in their leaves!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of our afternoon, we walked along the tram path, sightseeing the reflecting pool with Rolex clock, Chilton Azalea Garden, Goldman Stone Mill, Edible Academy, and Magnolia Collection. We tried to catch a ride back to the main entrance but were passed by full trams, so we rewarded ourselves at the end with hot chocolate and a yuzu soda from the Pine Tree Cafe. We also stopped by the NYBG shop, where E happily procured a flowery hand cream and card for P’s upcoming wedding. K then got the true New York driving experience, taking double the time to get back home, while E took a nap.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Esha Wang</name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">March 20, 2022</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Legendary Mutton Chop</title><link href="/newyork-2022-01-13/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Legendary Mutton Chop" /><published>2022-01-13T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2022-01-13T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/newyork-2022-01-13</id><content type="html" xml:base="/newyork-2022-01-13/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;january-13-2022&quot;&gt;January 13, 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since K made the brilliant decision to get the both of us fake ‘rona on his birthday, E had to reschedule our reservation at Keen’s Steakhouse to Thursday night. Just two blocks from the 33rd Street PATH station, it was a quick trip on a chilly day. The restaurant decor was very interesting, with all the staff in black-tie and the walls adorned with photos and drawings of Abe Lincoln and old political cartoons. We were seated at our table with some delicious rolls and veggies with ranch dressing. K instantly knew what he wanted: the Legendary Mutton Chop, rare. And he convinced E to order the more expensive Dover Sole as well. E also got a lemon ginger cocktail, which K actually enjoyed (and couldn’t even feel the alchohol in!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/g9RfZUO9S6OWhKLRv78srw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/JnVw2KEQTp2QAT9-Hn6GXA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expecting a regular-sized cut of lamb for $60 at a famous restaurant like Keen’s, K was absolutely bewildered when this giant piece of meat was placed in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/qa9wnTALTOafQDW6ApaE3Q?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frantically searching through the Yelp reviews, we discovered that most people suggested the dish to be shared by two! Alas, E could not be of any help, yet K confidently announced, “I will do it!” The first bite into the mutton chop was like heaven, and K wanted to cry. The meat soaked in juices was so delicious, and the sweet minty jelly that was served alongside it created a refreshing contrast in flavor, texture, and temperature that ensured the dish never got boring, even nearly two hours later as K definitely showed signs of overburden. The previously consumed rolls and veggies became deep regrets, although the bok choy-like greens were still too good to pass up. E watched with great interest as K slowly traded his sanity and stomach capacity for more bloody goodness, as she had long ago finished her tasty, and reasonably-sized, fish and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Y-qGl79bQJ-m7-vdLYU2_w?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But finally, with much aplomb, K succeeded in eating two adults’ worth of mutton chop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KYlIjsLoSfqCnMFhFEyQ3g?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In complete disbelief, we somehow arrived at the crazy decision to still order creme brulee for dessert. It came out with a candle for K’s birthday, and K wished to not vomit later ( among other things). K had two bites and wisely left the rest for E. Stuffed and loopy, we walked off our dinner at Bryant Park, where there was a winter village and ice rink set up. E + K reminised and watched people struggle as the staff showed off in front of them. Finally, feeling surprisingly not that bad (the wish worked!), we went home to share our pics and laughter with friends and family. Just another increment in age, but a night and meal to remember :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the holidays this year, E + K planned a roadtrip across Arizona with Cissto, Meev, and Petri, meeting more FC friends IRL before the end of 2021. We got up super early for the first leg of our flight to Houston, but got stuck there for almost five hours due to Ulto’s weather curse. K bought a California Club from Which Wich but was still hungry so went back to Jack in the Box for curly fries and an oreo shake. Ulto jealously waited for fries dipped in milkshake through their own delay, while Ciss and E WTFroto’d in chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/XNRoDxIQS5iGOVRoL5MpRw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/48zzvrDpRtSjwsk4kj7SFg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally arrived in Tucson, everyone else came to pick us up, and headpats were delivered all around :3. From the airport, we went to Brother John’s Beer Bourbon BBQ for dinner, which had a party poppin’ outside (even though Petri said it was ALWAYS empty :squint:). The table ordered The Hot Mess, which turned out to be a bit too hot for Ciss, and a round of hot sauces, while E + K got tater tots, a surprisingly large half-rack of baby back ribs, and pork belly tacos. We really loved the hot sauce selection, with the vinegar-based BroJo sauce being our favorite. Stuffed and content, we drove back to Meev HQ, where we delivered Ladurée to the Arch-Meev and cuddled with Meevcat while we subjected Petri (and ourselves) to Laws of Eternity pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/9HEUR1QVSGWHMX8b81_o3Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up the next day to Meev’s niece and nephew running around the house, then K read some HOB and chatted with Cissto while Meev took an exam and E conducted an interview for an intern candidate. As we waited for Petri (for 45 minutes!) to drive over, we grimaced over Meev’s hotbar setup in person, and K suffered greatly in attempting to perform openers on her controls. When Petri AKA Fordaniel finally arrived, we went to Solid Grindz for Hawaiian food. E + K got spam musubi for the table (3 for only $5!), delicious portuguese sausage fried rice, and kalbi + bang shrimp with Hawaiian rolls and tuna mac salad. The meal continued the trend of Hawaiian food being better outside of Hawaii, and the staff was very nice too, giving us the shrimp for free after miscommunication over our order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/t2Zo9fA9Tr-1ZFD1ilffZw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/yENqhutDRpOA1Q9ZCm9iOQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we visited a Barnes and Nobles/Starbucks for some caffeine, where we stumbled upon a whole table dedicated to the new MXTX volume 1 novels. Meev instantly bought (and pet) one of each, while we browsed some other mangas and books. We also stopped by CVS for some painkillers (not Petri’s drink) and candy stock for the road, as we drove to Saguaro National Park East. Meev used the secret codeword “suffering” to unlock free parking, and we enjoyed a nice walk towards Endwalker, passing by lots of T-posing sabotenders/lunatenders. We also encountered a biker with screaming brakes, who passed us with a hilarious “heh” as we worried about his safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/k9SP9P2eQVWGyXwZBgLg-A?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KeJSeGPqS9Ko6IH-Z9JqYg?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/6WS2RJhjQUeWbNMJ0s--1A?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KzQ8NxVdS_KSeEO6Rk0ajg?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the sun began to set, we went to Coldstones, where E + K shared a large Strawberry Blonde creation. Then back at Meev HQ, we decided for some reason to watch The Last Airbender movie, which was exactly as bad as K remembered, and so boring that it put Ciss to sleep instantly. Following such immense shared pain, E actually made a good recommendation, and we watched The Dragon Prince season 1, while K, Petri, and Ulto built Meev’s new game table. We also helped Meev with some chores at the Arch-Meev’s request cause she smol, and then enjoyed a fantastic snack of Southern Comfort eggnog and Cheez-its. At night, Meevcat fell asleep on E’s legs for hours, and E even got to pet Evelynncat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/C1vEEdccSE-Hh8VHRHkXyw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, we said goodbye to two of the three Meevs and set out for Phoenix, accompanied for the first time by Meev’s impressive stereo system and AC demon “Astaroth”. Cissto picked up their rental car on the way to Petri’s apartment, and we were all impressed by the “compact economy” Mustang they showed up in. We got lunch at nearby Zinburger, where we ordered truffle fries and the surprisingly good California Burger Bowl (sub chicken).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Sy8hgkDAQRmd0JVyZ3Jfwg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/2iKP3JUnTK29ce3le9XN6w?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to the Bryce Thompson Arboretum, we encountered many confusing road work signs but no apparent road work. The signage difficulty continued with “rattlesnakes only” and some questionable navigation by Petri, but the arboretum itself was very nicely maintained and displayed many unique desert environments and T-posers. After seeing Cissto off, we (i.e. K) headbanged the way to our first Airbnb, a nice apartment with an impressive collection of 90’s memorabilia and retro video games. K and Meev played a couple of rounds of pixelated Mario Kart on the N64, then we walked to Sizzle KBBQ. We sent pictures of our bulgogi, pork belly, and seafood pancake to trigger Ulto’s FOMO, then rounded out the evening with MDZS season 1 pain for E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/kpBBa3tlRKmv2OsDNOercQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off the next day with breakfast at Alo Café, where we :witness:ed Meev pour 16 packets of sugar into her coffee. K ordered the Alo Signature Corn Flake Crusted French Toast while E got the Tortilla Espanola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FkyleH64Q0OJ7QrR0KJwzw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then drove to Sedona to kick off our sightseeing tour. First, we did a hike up to Bell Rock, and we were surprised to see snow on the trail. The earth everywhere was also a deep red color due to iron oxide, which created an interesting contrast. We got up to a somewhat precarious position, with a great view of nearby Cathedral Rock and Courthouse Butte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/bo6t5PVVRpW4dOCFHs2UpA?viewBox=625%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/wUpAIyTqSde9NnuPHWGTng?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we visited the Chapel of the Holy Cross, a large artistic Roman Catholic church. Finally, K had the honor of driving MeevJeep (due to unfortunate tooth pain) along Oak Creek Canyon to Flagstaff, though there was a disappointing lack of parking and trail access on the route. Our Airbnb in Flagstaff was very cozy though, and we settled in with pizza from Fratelli (meat lover’s, pesto cashew, and margherita) and more MDZS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/r-tXUqW3TDayqkAg5pF0TQ?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/GwHcVPDbTGenNHKjbNX_SQ?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/-Ow6z_edTZuWd8raSEJkBA?viewBox=625%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally on Sunday, we set out to see the Grand Canyonion! We started with breakfast at Brandy’s Restaurant &amp;amp; Bakery, where E + K shared a chorizo scramble, hot apple cider, and cream cheese blueberry danish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/cLKI8tx8QCivECPuHKSCKg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/G5SBPUy2Qy-iHR8-v0n5Bg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short nap later (yes, we did just wake up), we arrived at the park entrance to South Rim, where Meev’s password of the day, “misery”, was not as successful as the previous time. It was quite chilly at the top of the canyon, and we enjoyed a nice brisk walk to the South Kaibab trailhead along the canyon rim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/MowBzDi2S7uqNLGOpqnrEQ?viewBox=1404%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/7gsDmRPjSuybFNITR7tolQ?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting the trail, we ran into two elk grazing by the parking lot! They did not seem to mind us watching them, and they proudly pranced away after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/g7vHDGcGSrSZNyxdsVV8dw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also came across the trail map for the area and felt a bit nervous at the description of points along the hike. We decided to try for Ooh Aah point (moderate difficulty, equivalent to 74 flights of stairs) but not to push our luck to Cedar Ridge (difficult) and Skeleton Point beyond that (very difficult, and scary sounding), or even further to “Contact a park ranger before attempting”. Our Descent (and everyone else, too) started slowly, since it was a bit icy at the top with no railings, but as we made our way down the canyon and out of the shade, we began to warm up. We passed a pack of mules and a sign warning us not to hike to the Colorado River in one day (no problem there), and we eventually made it to Ooh Aah point. It was quite the breathtaking view, and we took some time to take pictures and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/jvycJ3Q6R3ugGrveuI0ttw?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/hnzbkdhrTOixFjJ8sZqFdw?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an arduous, but surprisingly not too long, hike back up the canyon wall, we went to the Yavapai Tavern for a well-earned lunch of elk chili and winter squash toast. We ended the trip with a visit to the nearby Yavapai Museum of Geology, which had detailed models of the canyon and a great viewing station. K then drove everyone back to the Airbnb, where we watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail and played Taboo (very close game 43-42 between E + K and Meev + Petri!) and Codenames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Mk5nB7zbQcapAmFSiauF0w?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last leg of our roadtrip before heading back to Phoenix was to Page and the Navajo territory of Northern Arizona. As we drove past Grand Canyon’s North Rim, we stopped by a group of Navajo stands selling various jewels, pottery, and trinkets. Meev finally found a dreamcatcher she liked, to match the FC logo, and a patterned bowl for the Arch-Meev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/m_o3cRfNRhafKoV8qdiVtw?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/jf0cOHgYQG2lJ9FFgPZlYQ?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Horshoe Bend, which had a very “moderate” hike to the unique view of the lazy Colorado River. E + K sat for a bit popping rock acne. We then went into town for lunch consisting of burgers and fish + chips from Slackers. In the afternoon, we viewed the Glen Canyon Dam, taking photos of our group T-pose shadows, and further down the road (dangerously close to Utah, according to Meev), an overlook over Wahweap Bay. For the rest of the evening, we managed to accomplish the impressive feat of finishing the last two seasons of MDZS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/ZrgwNqZPTyuGO57RPizVBg?viewBox=1219%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, we drove four hours from Flagstaff back to Phoenix. On arrival, we had lunch/dinner at Yutaka Japanese Restaurant, and E + K enjoyed some spicy miso ramen and California rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/V50IoAV2QwGMR96u3dUlnw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also stopped by a Lowe’s afterwards, where K got a replacement button for his coat and also T-posed the bathroom location for Meev. Unfortunately, Meev’s tooth pain got a lot worse, and we took her to the dentist. The visit was very strange, with the rest of us getting kicked out of the waiting room, and when they wouldn’t let her actually get seen, E almost aggroed the office as Petri tried to carry her back in. Ultimately, there was nothing more to be done besides schedule her an appointment back in Tucson, so we rounded out our time in AZ at the Phoenix Zoo, which had a winter Zoolights event happening. We stopped for some boba, which Meev and Petri really liked (Petri got two!), at Tea Swirl, and then it was finally time to say goodbye. Hug-pats were given all around, and Meev impressively satisfied her dream of picking up E + K (not even in lala form)! We were very touched, and it especially warmed our hearts to see smol Meev so happy at the end of our trip. We’re looking forward to the next time we can all get together again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K went to the city on Sunday intending to do some Sephora returns and to look for gifts for the Arch-Meev (and of course, food!). Unfortunately, we forgot the returns at home, so we did not visit E’s favorite place. But we still had a surprisingly productive day in NYC. Our first stop as usual was Los Tacos No. 1, where we each got two adobada tacos and a horchata to share. E went very hard on the toppings, and K got to try the red salsa this time. After whetting our appetites, we walked to Balthazar bakery in Soho to look for baguette heros for homemade sandwiches, but we found that they were only for wholesale. From there, we decided to go to Ladurée, though we stopped first at Dr. Martens for E to find her combat boot size. At Ladurée, we got a gift box of macarons for Arch-Meev, since it wasn’t something we thought could be easily found in AZ, and a rose croissant for ourselves (which was yummy but could have had more rose flavor in our opinion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/TZpkRXZDQaKQTcy7JwZZ9A?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we weren’t able to get a drink and sit down, we also tried out Matchaful, where we chilled for a while looking at FFXIV job memes and sipping Hojicha Latte and Secret Garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/PiR64DTBRHmbOPayVX3kZw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we passed by a giant A, which we initially laughed at and sent to the Dream discord. But upon seeing the inside of the pasta bar and noticing truffle (aaaaa) on the menu, we stepped inside for dinner. We ordered the $100 pasta sampler, consisting of five half-dishes for two, and were blown away by the food. First came the Tonnarelli Cacio E Pepe (black pepper) and Tagliatelle Al Tartufo Nero (truffle aaaaa), which were perfectly complemented by the Rigatoni All ‘Arrabbiata (spicy tomato), and E + K were already in carb + umami heaven. There was so much generous truffle flavor, and the perfect bounciness of the pasta combined with plating/presentation set this restaurant far apart from previous Italian places we had tried. We looked like savages fighting each other over soaking up the remaining sauces with bread. When we thought the food couldn’t get any better, out came the Tortelli Mantovani Di Zucca (pumpkin/pear/lemon zest/nutmeg/butter/sage!!). This was the most unique dish of the night, and E + K agreed that A deserved a Michelin star for this dish. We could taste every ingredient/flavor without any of them overpowering the others, and it was so delicious even with E dying from fullness. Finally, to end the meal and night, we got the 24K Gold Spaghetti (squid ink/sea urchin), which drew looks from the neighboring tables. While the squid ink was on the salty side by itself, when combined with the uni and amazingly juicy tomato, it became absolutely perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied and somewhat delirious, we made the much-needed walk back to WTC while marveling at how we keep randomly stumbling on such amazing food experiences with so little effort :drool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K did some homecooking for Thanksgiving this year after grocery shopping the day before. We started a chicken broil in the slow cooker on Thanksgiving eve, then added tofu knots, black fungus, and shiitake mushrooms in the morning. For lunch, we finished some leftover mozzarella sandwich ingredients, tomato egg soup, and curry noodles, while we waited for the broil and prepped dinner ingredients. K made butternut squash soup and blueberry muffins (first time baker!), and E made turkey bacon-wrapped asparagus, roasted carrots, kale salad, and some overly spicy potatoes (E mistook cayenne pepper as paprika :p). While we cooked and ate our yummy meal, we watched old episodes of Glee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K went to the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibit at the Brooklyn museum. On the way, we stopped by Los Tacos No. 1 for two adobada tacos and a horchata. We got the tacos loaded with everything, and K even used all three salsas - we then proceeded to discuss those tacos for the entire walk to The Real Real for returns. At noon, we met up with D + A at Vinegar Hill House, which had some very unique takes on breakfast foods. K ordered a large sourdough blueberry pancake, which reminded E of a burnt cheesecake, and E got a very fluffy omelette that K thought had a very interesting texture on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After walking D + A and their new tiny puppy C back to their apartment, we headed to the museum. We learned a lot about the history of Dior, and the fashion world in general, such as the fact that YSL succeeded Dior at the age of only 21. The displays were quite well done, especially the collections of works by all the heads of Dior throughout the couture’s history. It was very interesting seeing the design trends over time, though K’s favorite was still the dress with the lion’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the museum, we got dinner at a Laotian restaurant called Khe-yo, though this was one of the more lackluster meals we have had in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the evening, we did some heavy TEA prog, clearing Wormhole and seeing J-waves for the first time. Then we watched Last Night in Soho, just a tad late for Halloween. It ended up being a lot less scary than expected, though the cinematography was great, and E actually watched most of the movie without a blanket over her eyes, while K got away with just telling the TV “No” one time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Esha Wang</name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">November 20, 2021</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Snigdha and Udaya’s Engagement</title><link href="/snigdhaandudaya-2021-11-06/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Snigdha and Udaya’s Engagement" /><published>2021-11-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-11-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/snigdhaandudaya-2021-11-06</id><content type="html" xml:base="/snigdhaandudaya-2021-11-06/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;november-6-2021&quot;&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, E + K went on a morning run at Liberty State Park. Afterwards, we got lunch at Café Dolma in downtown JC, where we ordered Poached Eggs with Kiymali, Sautéed Spinach with Labneh, and Fingerling Za’atar Potatoes. We went to Trader Joe’s to stock up on ingredients and snacks, and later in the day, we got our delivery from Monterey’s Tasty Olive Bar, which E used to make a delicious arugula, avocado, and blueberry goat cheese salad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we went to Chelsea Market and got Chicken &amp;amp; Sausage Jambalaya and Cream of Tomato with Chicken and Orzo soups and a California Melt from Hale and Hearty Soups for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we went to see Porgy and Bess at the Met Opera, which we found quite stunning and surreal after seeing it in so many movies. We were so stunned that we didn’t make it to our seats in time for the show to start, and we had to watch the first scene of the first act from a screen. During that time, we realized we couldn’t understand any of the songs they were singing (uncultured af) and began to worry we would be sitting through 3.5 hours of gibberish. K pulled up the plot synopsis on Wikipedia, which helped, but when we reached our seats, we found that each one had a small screen that showed subtitles for the songs. This was a total game changer, and the rest of the opera was very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the show, we met up with I, who was in town for a business trip, and tried to get a seat at Momofuku Noodle Bar. The line was too long, however, so we went to Donburiya instead, where we ordered Katsudon and California Don, along with some taro croquettes.&lt;/p&gt;
