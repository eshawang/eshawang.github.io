&lt;p&gt;For the holidays this year, Esha and Kelvin planned to fly into Chicago for a week to meet up with Kelvin’s family, who they hadn’t seen in person together in quite a while. Unfortunately, Janet and Lindsay were visiting Paris at the same time, but they graciously allowed them to stay at their place, and Kelvin’s family booked an AirBnB nearby. The day of Christmas Eve, Esha and Kelvin went to NYC to procure some loaves of babka from Breads Bakery, which was all the rage on an r/FoodNYC thread, to give as gifts. Since it was nearby, they also booked a reservation at Pinto Garden, which was serving some very unique Thai fusion dishes on their brunch menu. Kelvin thoroughly enjoyed a crispy pork belly congee with garlic crisps, and Esha’s Sunrise Pad Thai complemented it well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/N1o97xCaQlmsPxosxCWoOg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the bakery, they almost bought a savory bialy babka, a special collab with Smitten Kitchen, but managed to find the original chocolate ones they were after. With three babkas in Esha’s Bembien bag (one for Janet and Lindsay, one for Wenqiu and Yiqiao, and one for themselves), they still wanted more bread and went across the street to the Union Square Winter Village at the sight of a Bread Alone Bakery stand. They browsed the lively shops and restaurant pop-ups before grabbing a loaf of San Francisco sourdough (Kelvin considered sending a picture of Esha’s new BFF to SourDohee). Esha then wanted to watch Avatar The Way of Water but was embarrassed to bring her friend into the theater, so they first dropped all their breads off at home. Until the 7pm showing, they shopped around Newport Mall for some jeans and black boots for Kelvin, not realizing that the food court closed when all the stores did. Their dinner thus sadly consisted of four leftover Panda Express egg rolls, but they made up the calories by getting a bag of popcorn at the theater. They both managed to stay awake and not pee throughout the whole 3 hour 12 minute movie, and though there were a few squint-worthy plot armor points, it was a fun and beautiful experience overall.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/WFtzW7C0TKuJfgvuvRyE2Q?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/xCuUdH_NTyW0AxntmamlMg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Christmas day, they had a short get-together with Shir, Ahalya, and Ian at their apartment. Shir picked up food from Tasty Moment on his way from home, and Ahalya, who had just come back from her postdoc in Switzerland, drove with Ian down from his family’s place in Fort Lee. They had a really nice time catching up about Ahalya’s Europe experience and work woes, and hearing about Shir’s new gf. Kelvin baked one of the babkas they had acquired, and as Esha was serving it, he took a taste of a crumb left in the toaster oven. The chocolatey goodness was amazing even in that tiny morsel, and his reaction induced the rest of the room’s excitement. Indeed, as each person bit into their slice of that gooey but crunchy, delicious bread, they were blown away by the flavor and texture and insulted that this was their first time experiencing it. Esha and Kelvin did not have very many leftovers and were happy knowing that they were giving some good gifts this season.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After their friends headed out, and they finished the rest of their packing, they went to the airport early in case of snafus due to Winter Storm Elliott. Expecting a busy security check and lots of standby travelers from the canceled flights preceding them, they instead were treated to 4.5 hours of delays caused by crappy gate management. They managed to entertain themselves listening to passengers from other gates applaud sarcastically for flight boardings, and a random guy yelling down the terminal “Stop flying United they fucking suck!” Kelvin also bought a pizza and juice for them to eat while Esha learned how to play Chrono Ark, until finally they were able to get on a plane from a different gate and get on their way to Chicago. Kelvin’s joke that his family might arrive before they did almost came true, as they landed at ORD just 1.5 hours before the others’ flight from SFO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FYLKoXs_R7qCbl2UaGaGUg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since their Getaround booking fell through, instead of driving up to Northwestern, everyone decided to get some food in their sleep-deprived bodies at Wildberry. The line was surprisingly short, and they enjoyed taking pictures of snowflakes in each other’s hair as they waited.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Rnatm72ISJ-Alhp_TIRXaA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KXac7N7YTNKKE0dULgkPfw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/3HowtnEYRfKDDg7Stufghw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once they were seated in their cozy corner booth, they excitedly ordered white + dark chocolate banana pancakes, chorizo eggs benedict, veggie hash skillet, and the turkey chili special with a side of fries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/IMfzMRY0StiMB_oWxcPcHA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything was a hit, and it helped energize them greatly (or at least motivate them to burn off the calories), and they set off north on Michigan Ave to do some shopping. As they crossed the Chicago River into Magnificent Mile, everyone was quite impressed at the city’s Christmas decorations, and they really felt grateful to be spending the holiday time with each other.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/dduz41WNTxG65hBrN8auYA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together, they browsed Nordstrom, still in search of black chukkas that Kelvin liked, Aesop, where Kelvin’s family tried a bunch of scented samples, skipped UGG with a line longer than Chanel (just why?), and Sephora, where Esha showed off her contouring skills on the Fang family noses. They also came across the largest Starbucks any of them had ever seen - four stories tall! Incredibly curious, they went in and toured the facility, which had coffee bars on the ground and 3rd floor, a bakery on the 2nd, and a cocktail bar on the 4th. There was even a roof terrace, which was covered in snow so unfortunately closed for the day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making their way back down, they decided to head back to Janet and Lindsay’s so that Kelvin’s family could check in to their AirBnB, and everyone could rest a bit before dinner. Esha and Kelvin spent their rest time trekking to Mariano’s and getting their obligatory half-gallon of freshly squeezed orange juice, now up to $6.99, and a watermelon juice as well. A glass of each later, they made their way to the green line, meeting back up with Kelvin’s family to go to Fulton Market District. They arrived early and, having some time to kill, went into Time Out Market, which Esha and Kelvin recognized from their trip to Chicago in June. Surprisingly, almost half of the restaurants seemed to be new, and after passing by each one, they all settled down on the second floor to wait until their reservation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/uZz-i8nZTZ2gXkZe99DkVw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/CbJafQpIQZ2OAWtq3wJvqw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the time came, everyone excitedly walked over to Girl &amp;amp; the Goat, where they were promptly seated. Despite the restaurant being completely packed, the service was great, and they started with drinks for Esha (you had me at aloe), Shirley (peach tea-quila), and Dad (riesling).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Ld2RGtCvTRqFJKc8XtSGbA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For food, everyone chipped in with suggestions and Yelp reviews, and they got pan fried shishito peppers, sautéed green beans, hamachi crudo, sautéed bay scallops, roasted pig face, sticky glazed pork shank, and goat empanadas to share. Although Esha had been slightly worried whether Kelvin’s family would enjoy the New American fare, she was quickly relieved to see that everyone loved the meal, with every dish eliciting wows, especially from Mom. They all had a fantastic time playing shishito pepper roulette and making pork shank wraps, while gatekeeping Kelvin’s diet. Everyone got to thoroughly enjoy their favorite dishes as they quite thoughtfully split the food according to their preferences. For Shirley’s birthday, they even got the green beans comp’ed and had a surprise coffee ice cream at the end to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though since Shirley herself was not a fan of coffee, they made the easy decision to go down the block for Jeni’s Splendid Ice Creams for extra dessert. Esha and Mom were completely stuffed, but Kelvin, Shirley, and Dad split a scoop of wildberry lavender and salted peanut butter with chocolate flecks. Finally having eaten more than everyone’s fill, and quite sleepy from both travel and food coma, they all headed home to get some well deserved rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/bCu0DdsxSWWjE3jInetjjg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, everyone met at the AirBnB, and Esha and Kelvin just happened to bump into Shirley and Dad getting back from Dunkin’. They warmed up a bit inside with tea and donuts before setting out for Grant Park. At the Agora, everyone took turns copying the statues’ poses and taking silly pictures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FW7l6SB7QZKpyBQzKntkMQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They walked over the pedestrian bridge to the Chicago marathon finish line, then continued north, sporadically hopping in the snow and watching Shirley make a snow angel. When they reached Buckingham Fountain, they crossed Lake Shore Dr to Queen’s Landing and got an awesome view of frozen Lake Michigan. The ice was just beginning to thaw, and they could hear cracking and moaning as they stood on the shore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, people started to get hungry, so everyone walked over to Revival Food Hall to grab lunch. Esha didn’t want to make decisions, so she volunteered for table guard duty, as Kelvin browsed through the numerous options. A few minutes later, he brought back an Ayam Rica Rica from Minhasa and a mushroom broth with roast garlic broth bomb. Shirley and Dad opted for empanadas and a chicken tortilla soup, and Kelvin also helped Mom find a warm noodle soup (Soto Ayam) to eat. The Indonesian fried chicken in the Rica Rica was a bit spicy and sour, so to help balance out the flavors, he went back to Electric Greens and got a Hemp Seed Crunch Toast.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Having eaten a bit more than they intended, they eagerly got ready to continue on with their itinerary, only to find out that the Art Institute was closed. They decided to shuffle their plans a bit and visit Navy Pier that afternoon instead, but first they stopped by the CBOT, which was nicely decorated with Christmas wreaths and ornaments.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/6vLuu9eEQ0imaij85MLV0w?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they reached Navy Pier, they discovered there was a Light Up the Lake festival happening. The designs were pretty lit, with some large installations like a rubber ducky, deer, and teddy bear. Kelvin was annoying and got in the way of many photos, but then thankfully got distracted by the memory cube game. Without really trying, he got 7th on the leaderboard and signed his name as Fro, only to discover that 5th place was held by Ko, which seemed good enough for him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After making their way around the festival hall, they got in line to rent ice skates, but the rink closed for cleaning, so, not wanting to miss their dinner reservation, they moved on to the ferris wheel. While the line for the elevator looked a bit scary, it was not too long before they found themselves high up above the pier, and everyone got some great shots of the city lights and skyline. Upon looking down, Esha was also reminded of the Crystal Gardens, but she was disappointed to see that it was closed for renovation too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone browsed the stores a bit after the ride, and then they took a bus to Avec. With all of the small annoyances of the day, they were pleased to find out that wine bottles were half off for Tuesday, and they ordered a Lise et Bertrand Jousset sparkling wine. They were even given a few glasses for free as the bottle was chilled!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/SdIlQ7ZySe6ghAW90voN7w?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For small plates, they got the charred cabbage, wild Mexican prawns, chorizo-stuffed Medjool dates, and hummus with baby carrots. The dates and prawns were highlights of the whole meal, and they refused the server trying to take the remaining sauce away, asking instead for an extra pita to wipe it up with. They ordered rotisserie chicken shawarma and Persian rice pilaf with lamb shoulder as mains, and they loved the garlic toum sauce, though they were shocked to discover another giant pita covering the pilaf, which they struggled to finish. Ultimately, Kelvin’s family took some leftovers home since they had already run Janet and Lindsay’s fridge out of space with babka and juice, and everyone went to bed with full stomachs and tentative plans to jog in the Chicago winter morning like crazy people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelvin woke up grumpy and sleep-deprived at Esha’s 7:30am alarm and begrudgingly got dressed for his least favorite form of exercise. They met up with Dad at the AirBnB and started their jog towards Grant Park. Esha’s natural talent and lighter frame allowed her to pull ahead of Kelvin, but he kept his grit and tried his best to keep up with her and Dad. Seeing his effort, they patiently took breaks to let him catch up. Though it was painful, the scenery of the morning sun over the lakefront made the run more bearable, and the view from the still icy pier was quite breathtaking (or maybe that was just their lungs dying).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the return trip, Dad taught Esha and Kelvin about good running habits, and Kelvin experimented with some breathing techniques and mental imagery which seemed to help. However, by the time they reached the AirBnB, his legs were dead tired, so they all went up to rest a while and let Kelvin get a drink and donut. After Esha and Kelvin showered and changed, they met back up with Kelvin’s family to walk around Millenium Park. When they had taken enough basic photos and selfies, everyone walked over to nearby Garrett’s to buy some popcorn to tide them over until dinner (no lunch allowed before Oriole). Kelvin’s family really enjoyed the cheese and sweet caramel mix, especially Mom, who kept munching all the way to Museum Campus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, they found that Shedd Aquarium was out of tickets until late afternoon, and Field Museum’s line was too long. They instead took a walk around the campus by the lake and were surprised to find that nearly all the ice had thawed on that side.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since everyone was a bit tired, they decided to go back home early to rest a bit before getting ready for dinner - Esha enjoyed a nice nap while Kelvin worked on this blog. An hour or two before their reservation time, Esha woke up and did makeup with Mom and Shirley. A bit later, the guys also got dressed, and Kelvin the Human Alarm Clock had to yell at Dad to wear something better than sneakers to Oriole - luckily, Kelvin’s boots fit his outfit pretty well, so he was able to repay the favor of borrowing Dad’s running shoes. With everyone looking quite classy, they booked an Uber and arrived just on time, though for the second time their driver was worried about the shady af drop-off location. After reassuring him that the dark back alley was indeed the right spot, they entered Oriole and came up to the familiar freight elevator/garage door. Kelvin’s family enjoyed the spectacle of the industrial waiting room opening into refined Michelin restaurant, as they were greeted by their server and had their coats taken. Their server was happy to hear that Esha and Kelvin had dined at Oriole before, and even happier to show them all the renovations it had undergone since they had last been there. While the restaurant had a cozier vibe with brick walls back in 2018, the new Oriole had a sleeker design, yet still emanated warmth with a number of fireplaces and comfortable seats. They had also significantly expanded their floorplan, and everyone was first led to the new bar area for preliminary drinks and appetizers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/q3VTp7D2QdCTs_HPjlDjxg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right away, Kelvin’s family was blown away by the drink pairings - the spirit-free Fresh and the Sparkling Sake that even Kelvin actively enjoyed - so much so that they forgot the pairing part and downed them before the arrival of the first food course. Mom also got overly excited and went behind the bar to take pictures of everyone with their drinks and got reprimanded by Kelvin, though the bartenders were very nice about it and even refilled their glasses. Everyone was thus able to fully enjoy the first pairing with the Sea Urchin, Carabineros, and Hiramasa, a beautiful set of three seafood small bites. The Sea Urchin started the meal off with unparalleled smoothness, while the meatier Carabineros with sauce américaine delivered the first deep punch of flavor, and the Hiramasa served to cleanse the palette and keep the appetizer portion light and anticipatory.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/J-MmZILuQpqsCxTtg9xr4A?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second course, everyone was led to an island in front of the open kitchen, where the chefs were busy preparing entrées for the night. Both Rosé pairings were introduced as drinks with complex layers to accentuate the multidimensional, and absolutely gorgeous, Foie Gras. The huckleberries on top added sweetness to the savory paté and perfectly baked bread, and gold flakes found their way onto everybody’s lips, which also matched beautifully with Esha’s Zimmermann top.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/jU909GfIQr6DLBtK_BKcYA?viewBox=1716%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After that stunning combination of flavors and colors, they were taken to their main table and introduced to most people’s favorite spirit, the Riesling Spätlese, and the Odayaka. A Spiny Lobster with matching coconut and honeydew froth that was reminiscent of Kelvin’s previous favorite dish, Pike, was brought out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/D1_wZcsTR2ScPEJHilzlDQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/xkmaIRniT7aEcJ4SDTs78g?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the drinks began to build up, and the chain of bathroom goers started, with Esha first confirming the upgrades to those facilities as well, which included Aesop hand soap, mouthwash, and lotion. An outright umami bomb was next on the table, a cup of Matsutake soup filled with black truffle pieces and tarragon leaves. Kelvin’s favorite drink of the meal, the Toasty genmaicha, and another Sake from Miyagi were extraordinarily relaxing and perfect for balancing out the strong flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/PCvgkqCYQomgEH1oG_Uq3Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/2vM1sZ-HQJKGV1yEYDAhXA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the next two courses, everyone was given a bit of seaweed butter and a bread roll for soaking up leftover sauce, a perk that seemed perfectly catered for Esha.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/RfVD4VcxQnqC5PNjtID9Pg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/sJYztGS1QWS4pSoycKuttA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A Meursault white wine and spirit-free Bianco, which was cool and refreshing with more subtle fennel, accompanied the Sablefish. Kelvin’s parents got their first taste of caviar, and the oyster sauce was very fresh and intriguing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/3HtR_8H5QAWi3_dKM7pdMw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/1yy5DV9vR1mCgmbjQqbuOg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second to last savory course was one that Esha and Kelvin were super familiar with - the Capellini pasta, an Oriole special that was Esha’s first experience with truffle in 2018! Their anticipation while the server introduced the dish was palpable, and it turned out to be even better than they remembered, due to the new addition of crispy fried capers. The rest of Kelvin’s family thoroughly enjoyed the immense truffle flavor and perfectly cooked pasta in conjunction with the Barbaresco from Italy and chrysanthemum-infused Malty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/buldHaHoSC2JoSekmCDZXw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After everyone had meticulously scooped up every drop of sauce, a Saint-Julien red wine and Evocative shiitake consommé were presented, indicating the apex of the chef’s tasting experience. The climax of the meal was an absolutely delectable cut of Miyazaki Beef, served with a dollop of hakurei turnip pureé and roasted little gem lettuce. On top of each piece of beef the server also grated a bit of real wasabi root, which was so fresh and light, with none of the sting from horseradish. The meat, along with a small cup of seasoned broth, had no hint of earthiness, and both Esha and Kelvin’s mom found it totally delicious (everybody else was a given). They all agreed that it was the best beef entrée they had ever tasted and craved more despite being completely stuffed at that point.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/j3OH1xrLS_KM5yiux9KKKA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the main courses sadly over, everyone was served a Peach three-ways palette cleanser, which turned out to be one of the most fun dishes of the night. The flavors were surprisingly complex, with an initial burst of sweetness akin to haw flakes that gave way to a lighter fizziness due to the Tasmanian pepperberries.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/G8RXUcTITnOCIDrLk9F0LA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This transitioned into the dessert courses nicely, though to the girls’ distress, the first one was a heavier Soufflé with hot cream. Kelvin had (got) to help Esha finish the sauce in the middle, but the pastry part was too delicious to give up, especially paired with Crisp and Pear Ciders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/9Rb8ewgHQBuMkoWZ_K7ssw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The final course was a spicy one, a beautiful Mont Blanc soybean tart with ginger Zesty drink and Vin Santo del Chianti Classico spirit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/7qM2YlhcSFK2TIB_i9jaFQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And to wrap it all up, each person got their choice of tea, as well as two Bon-Bons with cute designs, though Kelvin was the only one who didn’t have to take those home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/cvx7ekoQRtmqWL5zOs6-JA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally having reached the end of their 3.5 hour long meal, everyone was beyond satisfied and in need of some serious focused digestion. Esha and Kelvin reiterated to their server that after five years Oriole still remained the best dining experience ever, and Kelvin’s family was extremely pleased at their first Michelin 2 star tasting menu. Everyone went home very determined to not get up for running the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FzMuvpoCT8mGi6J0qY9h0g?viewBox=1161%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a very good night’s sleep, during which Kelvin dreamed of the Miyazaki Beef, everyone got back together at Cai in Chinatown for lunch. They kept the dim sum order fairly light, then went to Joy Yee for some dragon passionfruit and honeydew smoothies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/JYug5vPoQjCCK9YwxUcW_g?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone made their way around Chinatown Square Plaza posing with the zodiac statues and laughing at the (in)accuracies of the fortunes. From there, they walked to Ping Tom Memorial Park and took some photos at the pagoda by the river and of the murals under the 18th St bridge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shirley craved some baked goods, so their last stop before heading to the red line station was Chiu Quon, where they bought some wintermelon cakes, a bbq pork bun, and a red bean paste cake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/S3ckDbK-R7Wb-WMxBl8CAg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back in River North, everyone tried their hands at Special Ops: Mysterious Market at The Escape Game Chicago. The five of them were paired with another couple and led into the game room, where Esha and Kelvin did some good work solving puzzles with canes, lights, and shoes. Dad managed to skip a step entirely to help unlock the door to the next room, then almost led everyone straight out the (false) exit. The group did less well on the second half, as there were some struggles with the flashy military screen and refueling minigame. Unfortunately, they ran out of time with two steps left to solve, though Kelvin was confident that they could have finished with just a few more minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Wu94iu1XTBS8bjx4oxnuVw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At that point, Esha and Kelvin had a dinner date with Erin, so they split off for The Cheesecake Factory while Kelvin’s family went to try Al’s Beef. The restaurant was just as Esha remembered it from her teenage years, and they had a nice time reminiscing about the last decade over their avocado egg rolls and surprisingly flavorful skinnylicious entrées.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/F1Aev3tzRU2zw8cJamdORw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, they hopped back on the red line to Wrigley Field, where the last Christkindlmarket of the season was thankfully still being hosted. With Kelvin’s family, they roamed through the winter village’s shops and food stalls, picking up the 2023 Christmas mug and some wafer snacks. When they had finished making their rounds, they all went back to the AirBnB to chill and munch on the day’s goodies before heading to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Friday lunch was at Lou Malnati’s on Michigan Ave, where everyone shared two pies, The “Lou” with sausage and a custom thin crust with spinach mix and roma tomatoes. Kelvin’s family really enjoyed the deep dish pizza and easily demolished it in their rush to make it to their tour on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At 1 pm, they arrived at the Chicago Architecture Center for A Walk Through Time, led by their guide Cynthia. The tour started along the river with Trump Tower and two examples of mid-century modernism, AMA/IBM Plaza and Marina City aka the Corncob Towers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FIFKzIYnS9iGXfXf31iwuQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/b1UU5X1qQtCXqDYNS1Nqag?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, they wrapped around State St to the Page Brothers Building, which featured Chicago’s last remaining cast iron front, and the Chicago Theater and ABC7 street studio, some of the first steel-framed skyscrapers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/tEKKDORCT1md8J6Dyot4sw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cynthia then took them into the Chicago Motor Club Building, which featured a large map of U.S. highway routes in the lobby, and the Carbide and Carbon Building, a completely over-the-top exemplification of the art deco style. Along with the prevalence of octagons, they learned about height restrictions imposed after the fire that led to many buildings sporting narrower towers above the 22nd floor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Crossing back over the river, they passed by the glass Apple store, then visited the Tribune Tower, which Esha liked due to its interesting Gothic design and wondered about its rent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/uLl8XUgJTgOJI5uk14ge_Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Behind it stood the giant NBC Tower, a postmodern building that somewhat mirrored the Rockefeller Center in NYC and also held UChicago’s Booth School of Business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/-KYWnPDORq6mfLxDW09eaQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the group got a good look at The St. Regis Chicago, developed by Jeanne Gang, and learned about its interesting and award-winning design. The shading of the glass on the undulating frustums reduced heat in the building (as well as preventing bird kamikazes), and the hollow section that everyone had wondered about provided stability by dampening wind-induced oscillations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/bTWHQHliRFOkqKFr7Bm5ig?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of their tour, Cynthia asked everyone’s favorite architectural style, which Esha and Kelvin answered with postmodernism and MCM, respectively (very in character), and Kelvin also offered “New Millenia” to replace the current Contemporary style naming. They thanked their guide for the wonderfully informative excursion and continued on to The Art Institute to complete the trifecta of Esha’s high school trip activities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the museum, they browsed the Photography exhibit and Thorne Miniature Room, then walked through the Arts of Ancient Egypt and Asia until they reached the special exhibitions.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the second floor, there was a series of digital iPad drawings titled The Arrival of Spring set in Normandy by David Hockney, which culminated in two hand-animated pieces that they found pretty neat. Above that, Esha and Kelvin passed by the Picasso paintings and various abstract sculptures of weird body parts and Amongus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After sitting for a bit and admiring the view of Millenium Park, they were wished a Healthy Happy 2023 as they left for Garrett’s round 2 and dinner.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/225oSyckQniU7Rcd8niVFw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Shirley and Mom picked up a few tins of popcorn to bring back to California, and Esha spotted a special holiday flavor - hot cocoa caramel mix - that they had missed the first time, before they sat down at The Purple Pig for their last big meal of the vacation. Their waiter was very persuasive in suggesting dishes, and they excitedly ordered the bone marrow, pig tongue, pork shoulder, grilled broccoli, crispy pig ear, and mussels. The bone marrow was a crowd favorite as expected, and the pig tongue and shoulder were also super delicious with their contrasting textures and flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the food was all cleaned up, everyone took a nice walk down Magnificent Mile until they reached John Hancock Tower, where they took the elevator up to the Signature Lounge on the 96th floor. Kelvin’s family was wowed by the view, and they all celebrated a fun holiday together with a bottle of champagne and a couple cocktails. There was much meaningful conversation and happy emotions, and they talked well through the evening to closing time, until eventually everyone went home to pass out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelvin must have gotten drunk somehow since he woke up early on the last day to go running by himself. After taking some selfies by Monroe Harbor, he returned to the AirBnB to see his family off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/YP2PynEYT3ugpckAuEBFlQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they had gotten on the bus to the airport, he and Esha headed to Chinatown for a quick lunch of rou jia mo, liang pi, and dumplings from Shan Shaan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;They chilled for a bit at Kung Fu Tea with boba and popcorn chicken, and soon enough it was time to head to the airport themselves. Their flight back was not quite as delayed, and though they missed the fireworks flying in, they enjoyed celebrating the New Year with the bus crowd, and some relaxed home cooking and kitty cuddles the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the end of a busy work week, Esha wanted to get out of the apartment for a bit, so Kelvin found a restaurant in The Heights called Ozu which had pretty good reviews. When we arrived, we were surprised that the place was very hole-in-the-wall, and had a total of only five seats. Luckily, there was a group before us who were just finishing up, so we got seated rather quickly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Butp6m8xSY-Zhip2hivLRQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with the curried cauliflower &amp;amp; Asian pear, which came out piping hot and delicious. Notes were taken on how we could improve our own homemade curry cauliflower soup. Next, we ordered the popular Ozu ramen as well as the beef bento. The ramen tasted very unique. The broth was clear and mostly shoyu-based, while the pork was thick-cut and crispy on the outside. The beef bento included a soba side, which Kelvin was very pleased about, as well as some mystery veggies that tasted somewhere in between a potato and yam. Lastly came the okonomiyaki, which was thicccc. At this point, we had already ordered way too much food, and only managed to eat two small slices before packing the rest to go. Overall, very solid experience and we are super excited to order from Ozu again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For Thanksgiving this year, Esha joined Kelvin (who flew in early for work) in Austin to hang out and cook with Joel and Amanda. The morning of, Amanda made simple but delicious Taiwanese pancakes with egg and pumpkin floss, and Kelvin helped construct some pretty inspired blueberry date ._.’s .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/RPeMo1mHRK2-hwU4udFzdA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/UuTOx-1RQFCm6x-uvzM8bw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While they waited for Esha to get in, Kelvin played Loop Hero on Joel’s Epic account and introduced them to another Chinese Netflix show, The King’s Avatar. Mid-afternoon, they started getting to work, with Kelvin oven roasting the Xu family butternut squash, and Joel and Amanda starting the prep for a variety of meat and veggie stews. After the squash was done, Kelvin and Joel took a break to pick up Esha from the airport. When they arrived back at Hotel XuLu, Esha made her green onion pancake again, as Kelvin finished up his soup using the fancy Vitamix blender and grated nutmeg. Joel made kale with pork hock (RIP collard greens), and Amanda carried with an impressive charcuterie board, stuffed mushrooms, and an authentic Taiwanese casserole with konjac (Kelvin as the blendmaster helped with a homemade peanut butter sauce). The spread looked beautiful on the new dining table, and many pictures were taken and foodgasms had.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Fyk9RsLTQDC4HOqNncI0KQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/8tCCGI9OR8aExcZ9qmmAtA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After stuffing themselves to the brim, they pulled out a Strawberry Book Club cake (strawberry chiffon with black pepper crust, strawberry ganache infused with basil and pink champagne, and strawberry Chantilly cream!) that Kelvin and Joel had picked up from Paper Route Bakery the day before, and extra-stuffed themselves. They wound down the night with post-dinner cleanup and a few rounds of The Crew, which Esha quite enjoyed due to the cooperative aspect, and Kelvin happily ordered a copy for themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/N4QUaQeoR8q9B7_fmEq2RA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, Joel had to watch the rolls, so Amanda took Esha and Kelvin for a tour of East and downtown Austin. They started with some lattes and pastries at Greater Goods Coffee, a very hip coffee shop on E 5th St.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/oy7cQQl7Ryyp1DHDUUfOkg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/dywqEsHpS8utAQUERGZCdA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, they wandered for a few blocks, checking out a couple of small shops, where Esha and Amanda found some bags they really liked from Bembien. Next, they headed to S Congress Ave, where there was an outdoor mall with a surprisingly large selection of well-known brands. Esha and Kelvin found a new store they liked called Alo Yoga, where Esha ordered some comfy sweatpants, and Kelvin found a beanie that actually fit his giant head. Further down the street, they enjoyed browsing some authentic southern shops, featuring a bar in each one, and all manner of cowboy hats and wall-to-wall varieties of boots. They picked out a couple candidates for Amanda to try to bring some Texas flare to her upcoming Taiwan wedding.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/VNzOHFYaRhWqk7zNYH2W8g?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When Joel finished his trading, he drove by and picked up the three of them for a late lunch. Continuing the food truck/gas station trend from earlier in the week, they found themselves in a warehouse area surrounded by breweries, which gave Kelvin SD vibes. They got delicious fried chicken, tater tots, and papaya salad from a truck outside Spokesman South, where they sat down to eat and watch a soccer game.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/LxDfqKpLQsyqveqlcsXQeA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also following the trend of weird opening times in Austin, they then moved to Texas Saké Company and ordered a flight of unique drinks and hand rolls from their adjacent truck as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/DZJa4jUNT6K0j_W86-h37g?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before heading home, everyone took Esha on a tour of Central Market, where she enjoyed the huge variety of foods, especially the various seasoned meats and large cheeses section. For dinner, everyone worked on the yummy Thanksgiving leftovers, and then walked off their day of eating around Bryker Woods, looking at the huge houses and lawns.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/cZS2WrCLQQ6dr5M4ATUjog?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esha and Kelvin woke up early (relatively) looking forward to the much-hyped pink taco truck outside Hotel XuLu. However, Taqueria Anyeli was randomly closed, which Kelvin attributed to karma for his trolling Brandon last time, so Joel and Amanda opted to take them to Civil Goat instead. Esha got an avocado and crunchy garlic salad, and Kelvin enjoyed his usual Cuerny Sam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/iPfWS3lsRtq_9xxMJjcypQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With a few hours to kill before their flight, they then took a nice walk by Shoal Creek, which had filled up quite a bit from the rain. The greenery was very pretty, and they passed by a family playing fetch with their dog, who looked like he was having the time of his life jumping in and out of the water. As they finished their trail loop and drove past the rolling green hills to the airport, Kelvin felt very impressed by Austin’s landscape, and Esha agreed that it would be nice to visit more (as long as it’s not too hot).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just a few weeks later, Kelvin returned to Austin for QP’s annual holiday party (sadly, without Esha in tow). Kelvin arrived at AUS on Tuesday night to find a driver waiting for him, who dropped him off back at Hotel XuLu, where Brandon was staying as well. Joel jebaited the two of them with an early morning call, but Kelvin arrived at the office in good spirits when he saw presents under the office Christmas tree. When everyone arrived, they opened their gifts, a sweet Away brand backpack with many office goodies and company swag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/diym07zcTLGoTn5vWZthUw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After work, the whole team rode to their first event at Topgolf, albeit with a risky bus factor. Learning to golf was harder than Kelvin gave it credit for, though he received some good instruction from Joel, Casey, and Devin. Brandon’s fantasy ratings were quickly in shambles as he did better than expected, and Julio was a total dark horse, hitting clean drive after drive despite having “not touched a club in 15 years”. Devin, Kerry, and Casey rocked the scoreboards, and Devin even started hitting left handed with Brandon’s clubs. It was a fun night, and Kelvin’s form was a bit better by the end of it, though his arms were definitely still sore in the wrong places. In classic QP fashion, the company didn’t meet the minimum charge amount, so Taylor and Inna bought some “trophies” to distribute to the team later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next night’s event was more Kelvin’s style, as the team was driven out to the famous Circuits of the Americas racetrack for Go-Kart racing. Though they didn’t drive on the racetrack itself, Kelvin and Ambaj snuck away for a bit during the instructional video to get some pictures of it. Go-Karting was very exciting, and in the very first lap of the night Kelvin hit two coworkers and spun out three times. He clawed his way back to the middle of the pack, though he wasn’t quite able to catch up to the guys who were white-knuckling and had sore backs the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After finishing the races and walking through the carnival a bit, the team hit up a bar for some tacos and pool, where Kelvin^2 beat ex-CCM before heading back home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the final night of events, everyone dressed up a bit and had a nice sit down dinner at La Condesa. On the way to the restaurant, Bill pulled out a magazine with Casey’s face on the cover, and Kelvin had a great time reading it out as they walked. When they had settled into their private subterranean lair, Taylor and Inna started the evening by handing out superlatives awards while everyone sipped their drinks - Kelvin received “Most angered by technology” for his FPGA rants throughout the week. The Topgolf trophy mug came packed with candy and a nice extra bonus from QP, though the partners just received a thanks. Dinner was delicious, a modern Mexican fusion feast which surprisingly Brandon liked, and the conversations were wild, as the Nirvana guys yelled about killing the Eagle killer, and Casey regaled the table with the tale behind the magazine cover. At the end of dinner, the partners did speeches, where Devin was excited for things ahead, Kerry thanked everyone who was a part of the company, and Joel was glad that they hadn’t blown up for another year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, the team walked over to Elephant Room, a nearby jazz bar, where they got some more drinks, munched on their candy winnings, and worked on Joel’s interview questions. Kelvin, Joel, and Brandon said their goodbyes to everyone and left a bit early to grab Amanda and Kenzie and see the Christmas lights around Bryker Woods (they were srs). Finally, Kelvin bid the rest of them happy holidays and, after a short night’s sleep, flew back to NJ.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Monday, Janet flew to the east coast for work, and planned to meet up with Esha and Kelvin for dessert in Edison. After the work day was over, we first drove to US-1 Authentic Shanghai Dumpling in Edison for dinner, recommended by one of Esha’s coworkers. It was a relatively small place, so we had to wait about 20 minutes before getting seated. In the meantime, we stopped by a nearby Gong Cha and got some Lemon Aiyu with White Pearl. Eventually, we got seated at the restaurant, and had the most difficult time deciding what to order since everything looked so good. In the end we opted for the chive pocket to start, followed by some crab and pork xiao long bao, Shanghai cu chao mien, and finally some sticky rice shumai. The xiao long bao actually were not spectacular, but we both thoroughly enjoyed the chive pocket and chao mien. The sticky rice shumai was definitely the most unique item and we thoroughly enjoyed that as well, although we were reaching our stomach capacity and definitely struggled to eat them by the time they came out.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had some time to kill before dessert, so we stopped by an HMart for Esha to stock up on some groceries since Kelvin was supposed to fly out to Austin the next day. Afterwards, we walked over to Mango Mango and got a table, while Janet met up with us soon afterwards. We ordered our go-to mango pancake and Janet requested the Mo Mo Cha Cha, which turned out to be a hot soup made with possibly taro and sago. Both tasted great, and the three of us shared the desserts while Esha and Janet complained about coworkers. After dessert, Janet handed us Christmas/Kelvin’s birthday gifts! We got a cute board game and Kelvin got a pair of oven mitts to replace the ones that gave him second degree burns last time. Eventually, we drove back to Jersey City feeling super stuffed and super grateful as we looked forward to our upcoming holiday adventures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The weekend after Thanksgiving, Esha and Kelvin decided to catch up with some old friends and explore some new restaurants in the city. On Friday, they went to RealReal for Esha to consign some clothing items while Kelvin chilled on the boyfriend couch. Esha was hoping that Kelvin would shop around the store on his own, but he hates happiness so Esha searched for items in his stead. In a stroke of luck, Esha found a brand new men’s Canada Goose with a black logo, which Kelvin had been eyeing earlier that week. The sizing was also perfect! With an additional 20% off the already discounted price, Kelvin felt that the deal was too good to pass up on, and added the new coat to his arsenal of rare RealReal finds.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Moving onwards to the actual reason they went to SoHo that day, Esha and Kelvin walked to Canada Goose for Esha to try on some coats for sizing while checking in with Danielle and Andrew where they wanted to meet for dinner. We eventually settled on Mercer Kitchen, but being a Friday night, they of course had no reservations available until 8:30pm at the earliest. In the meantime, the four of us got some orange wine and hung out at Danielle and Andrew’s apartment, while we talked about turning 30, AI art, pets, and HFT, among other things. When our reservation was almost ready, we walked over to Mercer Kitchen and sat at the bar for a bit while they got our table ready. Over the course of the night, Esha had a cocktail and some prosecco, in addition to the two glasses of orange wine she had from before. As expected, the conservation got wild, and we fantasized about all the things that could be if we were unapologetically young, shameless, and full of hope. Strangely enough, I think Danielle and Andrew are the only people I can really have this kind of conversation with. We also learned that Mercer Kitchen was the location where Jay-Z and Kanye recorded their collaborative album Watch The Throne, hence the restaurant’s popularity. The food itself was good, but nothing to write home about, and the service was extremely slow. Both Esha and Kelvin ordered pastas, while we got a plate of oysters to share. After a long night of catching up and conversations, we parted ways on a high note, hoping to meet up again soon in the new year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/qTqCc3MKTZiwdKUHau80wA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, Esha and Kelvin went to the city again, this time to find Kelvin a pair of gloves around Flatiron District. We first stopped by Willow for lunch, a new vegan restaurant that Kelvin found nearby. The restaurant has very cute decor, with many photographs and artwork of willow trees. We started off with the French onion soup, and in Esha’s opinion, it was the best French onion soup she has had in her life (drooling while writing this right now). For our mains, Esha ordered the “Scallop” Cacio e Pepe, which consisted of linguine, oyster mushrooms, and creamy “parmesan” sauce. Kelvin ordered the vegan interpretation of a Philly Cheesesteak, with seitan and oyster mushrooms on a toasted sub. Finally, we finished off with a vegan banana pudding, which was surprisingly creamy. It was also extremely banana-y, which Esha didn’t like but contrastingly made Kelvin a huge fan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we walked off our large meal by going to multiple stores in search of winter gloves that actually fit Kelvin’s fingers. We eventually stopped by Muji, where Kelvin finally found a satisfactory pair of gloves. Being the Muji fanboy that he is, Kelvin was also drawn to the bean bag chair flash sale they were having. Kelvin had wanted to own a bean bag chair his whole life, and convinced Esha to sit on the chair on display. Esha, who was unable to get back up, realized that this was truly a necessary purchase. With much physical exertion, we managed to haul the bean bag chair, along with numerous other Muji purchases, all the way back to Jersey without too much commotion. We ended the busy weekend with &lt;del&gt;us&lt;/del&gt; Bubbles chilling on the new bean bag in our living room.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fall season was very busy for Esha and Kelvin, as many friends visited NY from out of town. On 10/16, they went to The Rubin Museum with Steven and Evelyn to see a new exhibit about Himalayan culture and art. Amongst numerous paintings and statues, there was a room with a giant HD panorama of a village that wrapped around all four walls, where they spent a while studying all the fine details.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/XkePFl5MSkmgxjPLwH4xcA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main attraction of the museum was the Mandala Lab, an interactive area relating the senses to colors and spiritual centers. Presented with a mirror for reflection and introspection above a series of tubes labeled “Arrogance”, “Entitlement”, “Inferiority”, and “Gloating”, Kelvin quickly grabbed a token and threw it under “I think I am better than others.” Esha had a little more shame and thought about it for a bit, but ultimately slid her token in the same tube. The roughly equal heights of the token stacks made for a nice statistical symmetry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/tSLP2J64QbeQpsf9etDgwQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, they took turns reacting to different smells chosen by artists meant to evoke particular emotions. Most of the scents were calming or whimsical, but a cigarette smoke spray was most unpleasant. After some calming meditation and drawing Bubbles PoseTM for healing, everyone went to channel their anger by banging on gongs, then dispersing the energy in a pool of water. Esha had some pretty loud hits, while Kelvin’s technique was more refined from his percussion training.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they finished making their way through the rest of the art exhibit, they stopped by a few stores for Esha and Evelyn to look at house plants and decor. Then on the way back to PATH, they came upon a pet store with an extremely outgoing kitty named Leila.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the 19th, everyone hopped back to 23rd Street to experience Sleep No More, which they had heard about from a number of friends. Of course, this was first preceded by trying a new restaurant, a modern Middle Eastern place called Shukette. Steven and Evelyn had very similar ideas to Esha and Kelvin, and they ordered two each of the frena, lamb sfeeha, and Joojeh chicken, as well as Not Your Average Hummus to share. A short walk later, they arrived at McKittrick Hotel, where they were directed through a dark hallway to the concierge, who had them lock up their phones. The waiting room was an early 1900’s style bar and stage, which presented an interesting vibe as the guests mingled and were given poker cards for access. While Evelyn was instantly called and whisked away into the Hotel, the rest of the group was held back, so Esha used the time to down a Halloween special cocktail at the bar. When it was finally their turn to enter, they were presented with masks to distinguish themselves from the actors and actresses, then set free into the Sleep No More experience. Esha and Kelvin random walked down a couple of floors, until the maid character caught Kelvin’s interest with her sus expressions, and they followed her perspective for a while. They witnessed much plotting, murder, and infidelity as they wound through the Hotel following the story, getting lost and switching characters a few times along the way. While the acting and ambience were striking, the overall experience was a bit disjointed and confusing - the full plot was somewhat difficult to follow, and Kelvin didn’t even realize when it looped the first time! After the very dramatic ending scene of the last loop, everyone reconvened at the gift shop, where Kelvin and Steven split a book to attempt to decipher the story and family tree, and Esha bought a cool retro poster. In the end, online guides to Sleep No More proved the most informative, and they wished they had read some spoiler-free ones before attending.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/9u9ivJAsRqCUyWHpA5mkPQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esha and Kelvin got back together with Steven and Evelyn two weeks later to see The Music Man, starring Huge Jacked Man and Sutton Foster. They originally planned to eat at Ellen’s Stardust Diner, but despite arriving two hours before showtime, the line proved too formidable, and they didn’t want to rush either the dinner or musical experience. They instead decided to go to Urban Hawker, a nearby Singaporean food hall, where Esha and Kelvin got some fried rice, chicken, and boba. Everyone then made the short walk to the Winter Garden Theatre, and they settled into their (pretty nice) seats for the musical. Seeing Hugh Jackman up close was a surreal experience, and his charisma made every scene memorable, while his figure evoked Kelvin’s jealousy. Sutton was very cute too, and the two co-stars played off each other super well. Their antics had the crowd rolling in laughter, to the point that they broke character for a good few minutes as Hugh trolled Sutton with his impromptu dance moves. The story itself was quite heartwarming, and Benjamin Pajak playing Winthrop did a great job drawing people’s sympathy and spraying them with spit. Everyone had a fantastic time and cheered on the Broadway Cares charity drive after the show, as some well-off audience members bid past $4000 for Hugh Jackman’s gloves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way home, Esha and Kelvin stopped at Grace Street for a matcha basque cheesecake and sunset lemonade to satisfy their sweet tooths.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/ZuNhtBouQ_GyHBBkJvWuFA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday morning, Steven and Evelyn came over to Jersey side, and Kelvin drove everyone upstate to Blooming Hill Farm. While they decided what to order, Evelyn admired the plethora of plants and pointed out the breeds she recognized and grew at home, as the rest of the table dodged a bee that was equally interested. They started off with a pair of hot apple ciders, which were sugary enough that the bee promptly dive bombed into one. Luckily, Steven was granted another cup, and the rest of the meal passed much more peacefully. While Steven and Evelyn tried one of the pizzas, Esha opted for a giant beets &amp;amp; greens salad and squash &amp;amp; apple soup, and both couples got a fall hash, which was Kelvin’s favorite by far.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After trying their best but still ending up with tons of leftovers, they went to peruse the farmstand, where Esha bought a sweet smelling quince to make jam with later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/3sjd3CApQEqQy33InXNR_Q?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, they drove to Bear Mountain, which was many times more packed than Kelvin had ever seen it, so they knew that they had finally picked the right week to go. Indeed, the fall foliage was right at its peak, and the colors were totally eye-popping. They took a relaxing walk around the lake, breathing in the brisk autumn air and taking photo lessons from Esha. As usual, Kelvin was forced to model her numerous, and sometimes confusing, directions, but this time Steven was dragged into it as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the loop, they stopped by the gift store, and Kelvin managed to snag the last remaining “Trespassers Will Be Composted” sign to gift Vivian on their upcoming trip to Austin. They enjoyed a nice drive back to NJ accompanied by Taylor Swift’s Midnights, and Steven and Evelyn were able to make it to their vibraphone concert in Brooklyn on time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few days later, Kelvin’s dad flew into town to participate in the NY marathon. Esha and Kelvin picked him up from the airport and stopped by Honshu for dinner, before settling in to play with Blossom, see Bubbles embarrass herself for another man, and watch Enola Holmes 2 on Netflix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Dad left bright and early to tour lower Manhattan, where the marathon wouldn’t run, as Esha and Kelvin worked during the day (yes, playing with kibbies is hard work). For dinner, they went back to McKittrick Hotel, this time to meet up with PJ and eat at Gallow Green, the Instagrammable rooftop restaurant. As they enjoyed their Sleep No More and Dew Drop cock/mocktails, they caught up with PJ’s impromptu travels and always interesting love life. After they had finished their burgers and salad, Kelvin’s dad dropped in as well, having walked all the way down from Central Park, and they savored some panna cotta, ice cream, and key lime pie desserts before taking the old wooden elevator back down and heading home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Dad left bright and early to go to brunch with his running buddies - Esha and Kelvin had lunch plans of their own, though they woke up much later. With the help of the subway, they reached Spring Café on time, just as all their friends arrived as well. Steven and Evelyn had already experienced the hype, but the vegan bento, noodles, and buns were very well received by Joel and Amanda.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, everyone got boba from iMilky, then they walked towards SoHo, where the boys split off to visit FiDi while the girls started their shopping trip at Polène. As KeIvin, Steven, and Joel made their round-trip to the southern tip of Manhattan and back, laughing about IT and finance and watching a woman make her poor daughter touch The Bull’s balls, Esha was busy peer pressuring Evelyn and Amanda to buy a Hermés coat at The RealReal. She was ultimately successful in her endeavor, as Evelyn led the DPS race going into Gentle Monster. The boys met back up with them there, and Amanda put herself on the board with a pair of sunglasses. At this point, Esha was in the negatives due to her return at RealReal, but she wasn’t going to go down without a fight. They stopped at Zimmermann next, and the boyfriends became well acquainted with the couch as a nautical themed fashion show was put on for them. Esha fell in love with the unique patterns and styles produced by the brand, and they eventually walked out with her in a solid second place. They browsed a few more stores including Off-White and Toteme (Gottem), until it was time for Joel and Amanda to head back to get ready for their friend’s wedding. Esha and Kelvin ordered South Lions for dinner, and Dad brought back a ton of carbs to load up for the marathon. They watched a few episodes of The Last Dance before food coma-ing and calling it a night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Dad left bright and early to run! While he was making his way through the five boroughs, Esha and Kelvin had lunch at Thai Villa, which they found on a list of NYC’s prettiest restaurants. Though the decor was definitely top-notch, and the reservation difficult to book, the food was not quite as good as it looked, with the Royal Pad Thai being the best dish of the meal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch and a bit of Muji browsing, they headed up to Central Park to hang out at the marathon finish line. By watching the runners’ app, they were able to tell when Dad neared the last corner, but they were made to wait a while as they saw him take his sweet time recording the city spectacle around him. When he finally heard their shouting and cheering, Dad was so excited and ran over to celebrate, ruining some poor racer’s time by asking for a picture with Esha and Kelvin. As he went on to finish the race and collect his medal, the two of them took a nice walk through Central Park, which was stunningly beautiful that day in peak foliage. Though it was quite an ordeal finding Dad again and making it to the subway, it was a worthwhile experience to see, and they were glad they took the opportunity to attend. On the final day of Dad’s trip, he left bright and early to drive to Princeton to meet some old college friends - the theme of this weekend was that he was way more popular than Esha and Kelvin could ever hope to be. On his return, he left them with a huge bag of Chinese veggies from his friend’s garden before they dropped him off at Newark Airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Music Man set off an interesting chain of events, as Esha and Kelvin read that Sutton Foster had been in Gilmore Girls, so they rewatched A Year in the Life, in which she played an actress who had performed in the off-broadway musical Kinky Boots, which Kelvin learned was ending its current season at Stage 42, so they caught the last Friday showing on 11/18! Since it was a smaller theater, the show was very up close and personal, and though it started off a bit slow plot and music-wise, once Lola hit the stage everything transformed. Callum Francis was quintessential and carried the emotional experience, and the flash and humor of the production were eye-opening for Esha and Kelvin. After the last musical number, which had the whole theater hyped, standing up and clapping along, they were rather sad that it was over. Reflecting on the show, they went across the street to Ollie’s Sichuan, where the owners seemed happy to see some Asian customers, to grab a bite to eat while reviewing the history of Kinky Boots.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/1Lg408yHRB2t8ArniXXqfA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied with their dinner, they walked back towards the PATH station, happening to stumble upon the Bryant Park Winter Village that they had perused after Kelvin’s birthday at the beginning of the year. They took their time checking out a number of Christmas stores, and Esha ate her first whoopie pie! Having thoroughly explored the village and vowing to come for an actual meal sometime, they went home to rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/WiyOJ3uqSnKzGBJiSkaSaw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day was JC Friendsgiving, hosted at their apartment. Esha made her famous green onion pancake and both a kale salad and mozzarella tomato salad. Kelvin prepared his muhammara and red cooked pork with bean curd and quail eggs. Boyu and Amy picked up Rohu fish from Korai Kitchen and Peking duck from Pinch Chinese, and brought their homemade silk squash soup and snow pea leaves too. Finally, Udaya and Snighda brought delicious apple and cherry pies and Pebble. Everyone had a fun evening talking about their holiday plans and Udaya’s imminent graduation, and playing some Coup. Esha and Kelvin’s cooking received a lot of compliments, which was something Kelvin never thought he would hear - his efforts this past year have bore some fruit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esha and Kelvin made a short SoCal trip out of their last wedding of the year. Flying into SD, Kelvin was literally bouncing in anticipation of their first meal at Lucha Libre. They got there right at opening time and ordered their usual Surfin’ Californias, which were as delicious as expected. The new salsa counter was a nice clean upgrade, though Esha’s favorite mango salsa was missing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/OoAnde1pQ1yPbt_7etG4WQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With some time to kill before their AirBnB check-in, Kelvin drove to Torrey Pines Beach, where they dipped their feet in the cool ocean and napped for a while.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/t0RR2TqMSIeJxX_2J0SVRw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After picking up a smoothie and juice from Earth Café, they then set out for Temecula. Kelvin zoomed a bit to maximize time for Esha to get ready, and though the heat and ants in the AirBnB made it difficult, they arrived at Jenny and David K.’s wedding at Fazeli Cellars in good fashion. Esha wore a pretty black dress with flower print, and Kelvin wore not khakis. They mostly chatted with Danielle and Andrew, fawning over Cici’s wedding outfit before the ceremony. The wedding screamed derp, as the flower girl was escorted down the aisle by two Rilakkuma bear onesies, and after Michael’s officiating over the vows, Jenny and David walked off to an “I Just Got Married” Lonely Island remix.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/nPT08JO4RWaDcGS4WJ3DFw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the reception, to no one’s (real) surprise, there was boba for all the guests, though it was surprisingly good and cold for being catered from Riverside. At the dinner, Esha and Kelvin were seated at the TJ table with Danielle and Andrew, and they potentially made some new friends to play Overwatch with. After some fun dancing, taking a peek at Rex’s photobook, and cake and a decent number of drinks for Esha, they headed back to rest for the night.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/NHARAvFfToSQZQE-YCVAJg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Esha and Kelvin drove to Irvine, where they stopped by the post-wedding barbeque. They chatted with Jenny about Japan and NYC while David entertained tennis people with tennis. After saying their good-byes, they then headed out to get lunch with Phoebe and Leon, who had come down from LA to see them, graciously bringing Magnolia Bakery too! Their original destination 101 Noodle Express unfortunately closed, so Kelvin never got to experience the hype, but they had a great time eating Szechuan food at Tasty Noodle House instead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/akPibmO3QPqmyZmcBBoCxg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, everyone went over to Phoebe’s house to play with Toto, and they chatted a bit with Papa and Mama Ann too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/5d9ynlioRPGU33ZdeV_40A?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esha and Kelvin’s last stop in Irvine was David P.’s apartment, where they finally got to meet Eunyce, Nari, and Ori. They sat on the couch for a long time, catching up on life, cats, and wedding stories, and eating banana pudding. Finally, as dinner time approached, Esha and Kelvin bid them well and set out for the last hour of their drive to SD. Despite not actually feeling hungry, when they passed by Oscar’s Seafood Tacos, Esha couldn’t resist turning in. Unfortunately again, the restaurant closed early, so they went down the street for a few slices of Bronx Pizza instead. They checked into their much more comfortable AirBnB, and settled down for the rest of the night with pizza and wedding chocolates in bed while watching Mean Girls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Monday was SD tour day, which Esha and Kelvin started off with El Pescador in DTLJ. They got a clam chowder, Dungeness crab sandwich, and grilled sea bass sandwich to share. Everything was amazing as always, though the sea bass with a bit of hot sauce was the highlight for Kelvin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From there, they walked to Bobboi Gelato, passing by a new contemporary art exhibit along the way. After finishing their scoops of Medditeraneo and Julian apple pie, they drove to the zoo, where they studied impressive upside-down bird nests, said hi to a turtle, and watched the elephants play. They were excited by the newly opened Africa Rocks exhibit, which had been under construction the last time they visited. Though Kelvin (supposedly) tried his best to find the koalas, they instead stumbled upon a super cute red panda that was excited for its dinner time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the zoo began closing, Esha and Kelvin rode the sky tram back to the entrance then finally got their long-awaited Oscar’s Seafood Tacos. They had kind of forgotten how delicious the shrimp and steak tacos were, and were thankful that they made room for it in their itinerary.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/GuzdjaHySwW1zH_UbN8VeA?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, they stopped by the renovated Hillcrest Extraordinary Desserts, picking up a slice of Ivoire Royale cake and a pumpkin pecan scone. Esha was very sad that both desserts were extraordinarily delicious, so that she had to help Kelvin eat them as they watched Ready Player One.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Na3_KQEOQAqSEOg4V8wG-A?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Their last meal in SD had to be Leilani’s Café, and they were super happy to see their new customization options for the Hilo style loco moco! Esha ordered one with teriyaki chicken, Kelvin got it with Kālua pork, and they added a dragonfruit lemonade and two orders of spam musubi. Though Paolo later confirmed their suspicions that the portions had gotten a bit smaller, it was yummy as ever and a great way to end their trip. Except of course on the way to the airport, they had to stop by Lucha and get another two burritos to eat the next day :).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kelvin made a brunch reservation at Blooming Hill Farm on Saturday, so he and Esha drove upstate for some delicious farm to table dining. The restaurant area was large and spacious, with tons of potted and hanging plants that Esha wanted to take home. They were seated at a small table by the window and knew immediately what they wanted to order. Kelvin got the Wagyu farm burger with cheddar, pickled onions, and garlic aioli, and he and Esha shared the Tomato Bomb pizza with tomato confit and scamorza cheese and the root veggie hash brown. Everything was made super fresh - Kelvin especially enjoyed the rareness of the beef patty, and Esha loved the sour cream served with the hash brown.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After “eating too much” again, they picked up a loaf of Balthazar sourdough and headed to the farmers market to peruse some fresh fruits and veggies. They got a nice haul of apples, mushrooms, carrots, and some cinnamon zucchini bread to boot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Though Kelvin got ghosted on his plan to visit Afternoon Acres, he salvaged the afternoon by taking Esha to Bear Mountain instead. Walking by many happy families and doggos, they arrived at Hessian Lake, where Esha’s eyes were drawn to a paddleboat rental. She was initially wary of getting her new boots wet, but Kelvin convinced her to go for it. After getting their life vests and boat, they paddled out to the middle of the lake; Esha benefitted a bit from Kelvin’s recent max resistance cycling workouts as her legs got tired. There, they took a break and enjoyed the scenery and autumn breeze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When their time was up, they went by the lodge to get some drinks and snacks, though they had to wait behind a group of grown women buying copious amounts of stuffed animals for a gender reveal party…smh. They also stopped by a market stand, where Kelvin picked up two cans of yummy looking peach and cherry jam.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/48Yh-RdxR-y3qBkjXWD3qQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, they made the drive back home, and Esha made a new recipe for a delicious vegan miso sesame udon with pea sprouts and shiitake. They wrapped up the day watching Blossom watch TV from bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esha and Kelvin’s sixth(?)(!) anniversary cook-off competition came a week late since Esha was supposed to visit Chicago; her flight there was canceled but they stayed in and stress-ate instead. Wait, that wasn’t that different from competition day. Anyway…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As usual, each person prepared a main dish, and Esha chose a dessert while Kelvin made the appetizer. This year, they introduced a scoring system so that the winner would be official(ish)! They would rate each dish out of 10 in categories of difficulty, presentation, and execution/taste, with the last category worth double for a total achievable score of 40.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The morning started bright and early with Esha preparing bread dough while Kelvin made a shopping trip to Costco for the freshest ingredients. It was a good thing that Esha started early, since the recipe she used had an incorrect conversion that caused her dough to be too hard and un-kneadable. The second time around she used more of her own judgment and it turned out much better. As Esha continued with the difficult baking work, Kelvin was first to prepare and present his appetizer - burrata salad with arugula, roasted cherry tomatoes, and pine nuts, served with toasted ciabatta topped with basil and cilantro. While Esha found the taste of the dish delightful, especially the tomatoes seasoned with vinaigrette, olive oil, and black pepper, Kelvin thought he could have done a better job with the plating and reduced the amount of liquid at the bottom of the salad. Score: 3.5 difficulty, 3.0 presentation, 7.5 execution = 21.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/rvNZSP1AR1CKKSI9lrhIYQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esha’s main dish was a novel Hainanese chick’n, made of frozen tofu wrapped in tofu skin. The chick’n was cooked in green onion, ginger, and (real) chicken broth, slightly invalidating the vegan aspect but making it delicious, and served with garlic pulao, sliced cucumbers, sweet soy sauce, and a fried garlic ginger sauce. Esha’s care in the presentation of the dish shone through, and the immaculate combination of complex flavors and textures made this Kelvin’s favorite of the competition. Score: 6.0 difficulty, 9.0 presentation, 8.5 execution = 32 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/duOr7bu1R2GhX4xsobbVTQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next up was this year’s most expensive dish, Kelvin’s $80 king crab legs, injected and cooked with garlic butter sauce and topped with fresh parsley. Kelvin bought a meat injector just for the occasion and had a lot of fun poking the joints to infuse the legs with buttery goodness. The meat was so voluminous and fresh and incredibly satisfying to dig out to eat. Just the sight of it made Esha drool; still, the dish itself was not terribly difficult to make, and Kelvin’s wallet was mostly responsible for the taste. Score: 4.5 difficulty, 5.0 presentation, 9.0 execution = 27.5 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/6TR5LUzvRhOnpj4he6LHiw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, the culmination of an entire day’s worth of mixing, kneading, rolling, and baking - Esha’s very own version of the orange ricotta sfogliatelle, which the two of them had been craving since their trip to Italy. Though made every so slightly easier with the use of a KitchenAid pasta maker, it was still an arduous task rolling and coating the many individual layers of the semolina “log”. The filling was made by mixing semolina flour, ricotta cheese, and candied orange bits, which Kelvin stole many tastes of throughout the day of cooking. Unfortunately, as Kelvin was helping to take them out of the oven, somehow the heat of the baking pan transferred through the oven mitts to his hands, and he dropped the pastries on the floor. Esha had to stop what she was doing to run to the pharmacy for vaseline, as he suffered second-degree burns on his fingertips. Kelvin had to run his hands under the faucet for over half an hour and developed blisters in between layers of skin, and there was a prickling sensation for a couple of days - overall, a 0.0 experience which he would heavily not recommend. The sfogliatelle, on the other hand, though suffering a few broken pieces, were still delicious and impressive looking, and Esha and Kelvin thoroughly enjoyed making their way through them over the course of the week. Score: 9.0 difficulty, 7.0 presentation, 6.5 execution (9.0 for filling, 4.0 for pastries) = 29.0 points.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FhDXSUbpQfqh_nL_JiFaaQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tallying up the scores, Esha was the clear winner of this year’s shokugeki, for handling the parallel preparation of two highly involved recipes and excelling over Kelvin at presentation. Kelvin suffered his loss graciously (his burns not so much), and was still able to make two very yummy dishes of his own. He’ll look for revenge next year, as well as buy a new set of oven mitts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Esha Wang</name></author><category term="life" /><summary type="html">August 14, 2022</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Mangos, Memes &amp;amp; Musicals</title><link href="/newyork-2022-07-22/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Mangos, Memes &amp;amp; Musicals" /><published>2022-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2022-07-24T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/newyork-2022-07-22</id><content type="html" xml:base="/newyork-2022-07-22/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;july-22-2022---july-24-2022&quot;&gt;July 22, 2022 - July 24, 2022&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Esha wanted Mango Mango Dessert to celebrate the end of another work week, so she and Kelvin took the PATH to Hoboken on Friday evening. As they strolled down Washington St., they made a couple of short stops. First, they were drawn into Carlo’s Bakery by a sign advertising lobster tails, which they discovered are what sfogliatelle are called in the U.S. These were filled with a creamy custard rather than orange ricotta, but Kelvin and Esha still enjoyed one alongside a chocolate strawberry cheesecake.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/QApIHJ2pRSKuAUsDkmWrMw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Two blocks further, they grabbed a small dinner at Mamoun’s Falafel consisting of falafel, hummus, and baba ganoush. They made it across the street to Sephora before closing time, where Esha did a return while also planning out her regimen for Kelvin’s facial treatment (inspired by his mom’s bday gift). Finally, they arrived at Mango Mango where they shared a refreshing mango juice with watermelon and rice ball.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When they returned home, Esha persuaded Kelvin to accept his spa treatment while he lied on the couch. Thus, he got his first experience with Glow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Hyaluronic Clay Pore-Tight Facial, Innisfree’s Green Tea Cleansing Foam, SKII’s Facial Treatment Essense, and Glow Recipe’s Watermelon Glow Ultra-Fine Mist. Though he couldn’t stop laughing at first, Kelvin eventually relaxed to the scent of honeycrisp apple candle, Esha’s superb neck massage, and Cateen’s piano concert playing in the background. With a glowing visage, he then fired up the stream to play the new game Stray, but his spotlight was quickly stolen by B&amp;amp;B #catswatchingstray (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1540110682&quot;&gt;https://www.twitch.tv/videos/1540110682&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, after both working through the morning, Kelvin paid Esha back for the facial by dragging her with him to the gym (you’re welcome Nathan). They worked out for an hour, until Esha got noodle arms, then they made a trip to TJ’s. With their grocery shopping completed, Kelvin set to work trying out a new muhammara recipe they found while Esha prepped their homemade pizza. They happily devoured their meal as they watched the last season of Peaky Blinders, then Esha asked if Kelvin could make the My FFXIV Party meme for Team Jellicles. Kelvin pulled up some adventurer plates and attempted to copy them in detail, but both he and Esha found it to be a bit difficult. They temporarily gave up the notion after struggling to draw Garr and went to bed with some kitty cuddles.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, Kelvin found some artistic inspiration and started again on the drawing with a simpler style. He quickly found his flow and soldiered through all eight portraits over the span of a few hours, as Esha provided supporting commentary and prepared lunch. Together, they filled out the quotes and descriptions of Team Jellicles, then shared the meme to Dream, laughing uncontrollably as their teammates witnessed their likenesses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Kk5MZ1gxRPSC66YIjng_IA?viewBox=937%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With that task finished, they set out for Broadway to finally see The Phantom of the Opera, which Kelvin had been waiting 14 years for. Their seats were in the rear orchestra at the Majestic Theatre, and from the start, the stage effects were flashy (literally) and incredible. The boat scene in particular was breathtaking, and the music throughout was so powerful and emotional. Esha didn’t know anything about the plot beforehand and found the ending quite sad, and Kelvin, who had seen the movie many times, was impressed how good the character getup and acting in the real musical were.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the show started at 5pm, they walked over to dinner afterwards, continuing their vegan streak with Beyond Sushi. They ordered the gua bao, charred avocado maki roll, shiitake truffle dumplings, and nori taco sampler. Everything was super flavorful, especially the sampler of spicy jackfruit “crab”, sriracha “zalmon”, and yuzu infused “tuna”, which somehow all had the consistency of actual seafood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After dinner, Kelvin and Esha made a quick stop at NY Bakery &amp;amp; Desserts for some strawberry tres leches and white chocolate mousse cake, and a free cake pop to boot. They ended a packed and productive weekend relaxing back at home watching videos of Phantom and making up songs about B&amp;amp;B :)&lt;/p&gt;
