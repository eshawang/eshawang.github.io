&lt;p&gt;For E’s birthday, K planned an evening out in Greenwich Village. Right off the 9th street station, we visited Té Company for a box of Pineapple Linzer cookies before our dinner reservation at Pinto Garden. K did something embarrassing once again and was punished by E ordering bomba rice for two (actually a delicious Tom Yum seafood paella).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/GJLJm9aFQaSJSU2J57wIQA?viewBox=1370%2C1826&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E also got a Lychee Bellini, and K enjoyed a Lamb Massamun curry, along with fresh rolls with spicy peanut dressing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/RQXwnpC2TkabKiC5uDdGgw?viewBox=1370%2C1826&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The setting was beautiful, with flowers and fairy lights in an open-roof shed outdoors behind the restaurant. After dinner, we got mango lassi and honeycomb ice cream from Van Leeuwen, then waddled around West Village and Washington Square Park. We ended the night at Mezzrow, where we listened to Luke Carlos O’Reilly perform jazz and soul piano with upright bass and drums. It was really nice to sit down and hear live music for the first time in over a year, and both the band and the crowd had a wonderful time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/QU5Ndj13TsKipbATKEHsPQ?viewBox=2434%2C1826&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Funny highlights from the show included the band missing a drum solo, the drummer being told which key to play in, and taking credit for Norwegian Wood from The Beatles. Also, K double fisted grapefruit juice and rose lemonade soda - super manly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Rwex_418QrOG7LdsC66gWg?viewBox=1370%2C1826&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, we got back home and K surprised E with a newly polished Triforce.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Esha Wang</name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">June 25, 2021</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Visit to MoMA</title><link href="/newyork-2021-06-18/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Visit to MoMA" /><published>2021-06-18T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-06-18T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/newyork-2021-06-18</id><content type="html" xml:base="/newyork-2021-06-18/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;june-18-2021&quot;&gt;June 18, 2021&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday, E finished up a final presentation for her MCL project, and K had all his meetings canceled, so we went to the city for the afternoon. We stopped in at McNulty’s and got some Longjing tea leaves. K found a cute side street called 6-½th Street (like Platform 9-¾) with a French restaurant called Boucherie. E had the Loup de Mer en Papillote, and K ordered the Wagyu Bar Steak, and we shared a PJ Breeze cocktail. After lunch, we visited MoMA’s sculpture garden and north wing. E liked the display of words depicting cruelties against Native Americans. K liked the room of rectangles. And we were both thoroughly confused by the art(?) collection of museum furniture. After MoMA closed, we walked through Times Square to eat at Joe’s House of Soup Dumplings, where we had the most mouth-watering crab and pork soup dumplings we’ve tasted (better than DTF!). We also stopped by 7 For All Mankind to look at jeans for K - he tried on a pair and almost bought them with alterations without looking at the price tag, then noped the f out of there…we probably can’t go back to that store anymore.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Later that weekend, we ate noodles and curry bao at Yasu in Jersey City and got strawberry shaved snow from Semicolon Café (we loved the decor and high loft there), then watched the waves for a while at the waterfront.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Esha Wang</name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">June 18, 2021</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Weekend in NYC</title><link href="/newyork-2021-06-12/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Weekend in NYC" /><published>2021-06-12T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-06-12T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/newyork-2021-06-12</id><content type="html" xml:base="/newyork-2021-06-12/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;june-12-2021&quot;&gt;June 12, 2021&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K took the train to 14th street and got their first cronut ever from The Donut Pub. Our original plan was to grab the usual staples from Chelsea Market (lobster roll from The Lobster Place, dumplings from Mokbar Korean Grub), but were enticed by a sign for ramen along the way. We decided life is too short to eat at a place more than once and spontaneously walked into Kogane Ramen, where we ordered Red Tonkotsu, Miso Lobster (there was so much lobster!), and a sake which turned out to be way too strong for E. Then we walked around the L.E.A.F. Festival of Flowers in Chelsea. K liked the flower tunnel and the street sign displays. We also found Lucid Dreaming to recover our missing MP. After grabbing some L’Arte del Gelato and japchae dumplings from Mokbar anyway (life is funny that way), we attempted to burn those calories walking all the way to SoHo and then Lower East Side. Along the way, we stopped to listen to a street band consisting of guitar and two old guys on bass and drums. At Pier 36, we watched the Immersive Van Gogh experience from all different angles (back against the wall, lying on the floor, and up the stairs). We had a good time looking at the merch and synesthesia chamber while thinking about Vox’s video on museum For dinner, we tried to get into Joe’s Shanghai but were too late, so we went to Tasty Hand-Pulled Noodles, where we had just enough cash to get some roast duck and shredded pork pan-fried noods.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After spending many months at home working, cooking, and playing FFXIV, E + K finally got vaccinated and visited Norcal to see friends and K’s family for the first time since moving to NJ a year ago. S and K’s parents picked us up from SFO, and we got to see the new house in Milpitas. It was very cute with many flowers and fruit trees (lemon, peach, and dragonfruit) in the backyard and a great view of the mountains around Fremont. We enjoyed some yummy homecooking from K’s parents and then drove to see the sunset at Sierra Vista Point. We were super lucky, as we happened to catch the full moon rising as well, and there was a crowd of photographers gathered for it. Also, we saw some cows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next day, E had some morning meetings, while K played with M&amp;amp;M and helped with putting up new pictures on the wall and some IT work for the fam. We all got dim sum from Mayflower Seafood Restaurant (good food is so plentiful in Milpitas) and boba and popcorn chicken (of course) from T4, then went to play mini golf AKA 18 volcano holes. For dinner, K met up with PV + J (:joy:) at Mantra India in MV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Early Thursday morning (at least we were still on east coast time), K got up to hike Mission Peak with his dad. K was very popular with his dad’s friends, and they climbed to the top with a solid time of 1h20m. For lunch, we had Xi’an Kitchen by recommendation of Cissto, and we carb overloaded with chili oil noodles, liang pi, and roujiamo. Cissto picked us up later in the evening, and we all went to Valley Fair for some food and shopping. K got a light jacket from Zara, E acquired six(!) items, and Cissto got some skincare recommendations by E from Sephora. After filling our cravings for Chicken Wow and Somi Somi, we all drove to Cissto’s apartment in Monterey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;K started the next day enjoying the ocean air from the deck and looking for his namesake bird, while eating a healthy breakfast of milk and :butterfinger:. Once everyone was up, we bought California Chicken sandwiches and K’s favorite Hawaiian kettle chips from 3 Mundos. We then hit the road to Big Sur, with background music from Terry:D. E found a pretty field of flowers and hill to climb, with a DST resurrection stone at the top. K somehow forgot about Bixby Creek Bridge and McWay (Make Way “musical_note:) Falls from our previous trip but remembered the gas station and Nepenthe, where we ate again with a great view of the sea. Back in Monterey, we walked along the beach and pointed out the cute names for all the expensive houses we passed by. Then we strolled along the shops at Carmel-by-the-Sea. E + K bought some gummies and Turkish delights and looked at a photo gallery, antiques shop, and stationary store. We stopped by Cafe Carmel to rest our feet before Cissto’s dinner reservation. For dinner, we treated Cissto to Carmel’s Bistro Giovanni, where K ordered ravioli with prosciutto and E got the pasta piccata with chicken, and we all shared a tiramisu for dessert. Afterwards, Cissto taught E about ice wine, and we relaxed for the rest of the night with some video games. Froto signed on simultaneously to play some Frontline, thoroughly confusing Maeve, and then E+K watched Cissto try We Were Here. “Unfortunately”, Ulto picked librarian and had to deal with colored charts and books, while Ciss picked explorer and got lost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Saturday morning, Ulto picked up bagels, and we headed back to SJ for the first Dream Norcal meetup with Yuera and Hoid. We started with lunch at Starbird near E’s old Magnolia apartment (why wasn’t it around when we lived there?). In classic TC fashion, our WHM went to the wrong position to pick up our PLD, and Froto subbed in to grab him. After lunch, we visited TDC and hung out with Lauren and the new cats. K spent nearly 15 minutes lying on the floor to pet Kai underneath the storage shelves and also had a lot of fun feeding Ghost a Churu treat in his blanket fort. Carmel was the star of the show and attracted pets from everyone. Cissto found  Buttercup to match B&amp;amp;B, but unfortunately she was already set to be adopted. All too soon, the kitty session was over, so we headed to Teaspoon for some boba. We then decided to go for mini golf round 2, picking up Ath along the way. We ended the day with dinner at Shanghai Family Restaurant and got unexpected front row seats to a smash and grab, further solidifying K’s mantra to never take a nice car to Cupertino Village.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sunday was a chill day of sleeping in, homecooked meals, and hanging out with Techers. We went on a walk with K’s parents around Sandy Wool lake and got some nice modeling shots. On Monday, K’s extended family came over for a housewarming BBQ, and they played a lot of Mahjong. K’s aunt played very well and, combined with an amazing streak of luck, decimated everyone else’s chip stacks. Meanwhile, meat was consumed, a lawn chair was broken, and E’s guacamole was sorely missed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, on Tuesday morning, E + K flew back to NJ, but not without a last meal of all of E’s favorite dishes from TPK.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Esha Wang</name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">May 25, 2021 - June 1, 2021</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Photography Post 3</title><link href="/photographyposttest/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Photography Post 3" /><published>2020-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</published><updated>2020-12-31T00:00:00-05:00</updated><id>/photographyposttest</id><content type="html" xml:base="/photographyposttest/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;header&quot;&gt;Header&lt;/h2&gt;
