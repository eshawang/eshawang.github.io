&lt;p&gt;Since K made the brilliant decision to get the both of us fake ‘rona on his birthday, E had to reschedule our reservation at Keen’s Steakhouse to Thursday night. Just two blocks from the 33rd Street PATH station, it was a quick trip on a chilly day. The restaurant decor was very interesting, with all the staff in black-tie and the walls adorned with photos and drawings of Abe Lincoln and old political cartoons. We were seated at our table with some delicious rolls and veggies with ranch dressing. K instantly knew what he wanted: the Legendary Mutton Chop, rare. And he convinced E to order the more expensive Dover Sole as well. E also got a lemon ginger cocktail, which K actually enjoyed (and couldn’t even feel the alchohol in!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/g9RfZUO9S6OWhKLRv78srw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/JnVw2KEQTp2QAT9-Hn6GXA?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Expecting a regular-sized cut of lamb for $60 at a famous restaurant like Keen’s, K was absolutely bewildered when this giant piece of meat was placed in front of him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/qa9wnTALTOafQDW6ApaE3Q?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Frantically searching through the Yelp reviews, we discovered that most people suggested the dish to be shared by two! Alas, E could not be of any help, yet K confidently announced, “I will do it!” The first bite into the mutton chop was like heaven, and K wanted to cry. The meat soaked in juices was so delicious, and the sweet minty jelly that was served alongside it created a refreshing contrast in flavor, texture, and temperature that ensured the dish never got boring, even nearly two hours later as K definitely showed signs of overburden. The previously consumed rolls and veggies became deep regrets, although the bok choy-like greens were still too good to pass up. E watched with great interest as K slowly traded his sanity and stomach capacity for more bloody goodness, as she had long ago finished her tasty, and reasonably-sized, fish and potatoes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Y-qGl79bQJ-m7-vdLYU2_w?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But finally, with much aplomb, K succeeded in eating two adults’ worth of mutton chop!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KYlIjsLoSfqCnMFhFEyQ3g?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In complete disbelief, we somehow arrived at the crazy decision to still order creme brulee for dessert. It came out with a candle for K’s birthday, and K wished to not vomit later ( among other things). K had two bites and wisely left the rest for E. Stuffed and loopy, we walked off our dinner at Bryant Park, where there was a winter village and ice rink set up. E + K reminised and watched people struggle as the staff showed off in front of them. Finally, feeling surprisingly not that bad (the wish worked!), we went home to share our pics and laughter with friends and family. Just another increment in age, but a night and meal to remember :)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the holidays this year, E + K planned a roadtrip across Arizona with Cissto, Meev, and Petri, meeting more FC friends IRL before the end of 2021. We got up super early for the first leg of our flight to Houston, but got stuck there for almost five hours due to Ulto’s weather curse. K bought a California Club from Which Wich but was still hungry so went back to Jack in the Box for curly fries and an oreo shake. Ulto jealously waited for fries dipped in milkshake through their own delay, while Ciss and E WTFroto’d in chat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/XNRoDxIQS5iGOVRoL5MpRw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/48zzvrDpRtSjwsk4kj7SFg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When we finally arrived in Tucson, everyone else came to pick us up, and headpats were delivered all around :3. From the airport, we went to Brother John’s Beer Bourbon BBQ for dinner, which had a party poppin’ outside (even though Petri said it was ALWAYS empty :squint:). The table ordered The Hot Mess, which turned out to be a bit too hot for Ciss, and a round of hot sauces, while E + K got tater tots, a surprisingly large half-rack of baby back ribs, and pork belly tacos. We really loved the hot sauce selection, with the vinegar-based BroJo sauce being our favorite. Stuffed and content, we drove back to Meev HQ, where we delivered Ladurée to the Arch-Meev and cuddled with Meevcat while we subjected Petri (and ourselves) to Laws of Eternity pain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/9HEUR1QVSGWHMX8b81_o3Q?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We woke up the next day to Meev’s niece and nephew running around the house, then K read some HOB and chatted with Cissto while Meev took an exam and E conducted an interview for an intern candidate. As we waited for Petri (for 45 minutes!) to drive over, we grimaced over Meev’s hotbar setup in person, and K suffered greatly in attempting to perform openers on her controls. When Petri AKA Fordaniel finally arrived, we went to Solid Grindz for Hawaiian food. E + K got spam musubi for the table (3 for only $5!), delicious portuguese sausage fried rice, and kalbi + bang shrimp with Hawaiian rolls and tuna mac salad. The meal continued the trend of Hawaiian food being better outside of Hawaii, and the staff was very nice too, giving us the shrimp for free after miscommunication over our order.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/t2Zo9fA9Tr-1ZFD1ilffZw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After lunch, we visited a Barnes and Nobles/Starbucks for some caffeine, where we stumbled upon a whole table dedicated to the new MXTX volume 1 novels. Meev instantly bought (and pet) one of each, while we browsed some other mangas and books. We also stopped by CVS for some painkillers (not Petri’s drink) and candy stock for the road, as we drove to Saguaro National Park East. Meev used the secret codeword “suffering” to unlock free parking, and we enjoyed a nice walk towards Endwalker, passing by lots of T-posing sabotenders/lunatenders. We also encountered a biker with screaming brakes, who passed us with a hilarious “heh” as we worried about his safety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/k9SP9P2eQVWGyXwZBgLg-A?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/6WS2RJhjQUeWbNMJ0s--1A?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KzQ8NxVdS_KSeEO6Rk0ajg?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the sun began to set, we went to Coldstones, where E + K shared a large Strawberry Blonde creation. Then back at Meev HQ, we decided for some reason to watch The Last Airbender movie, which was exactly as bad as K remembered, and so boring that it put Ciss to sleep instantly. Following such immense shared pain, E actually made a good recommendation, and we watched The Dragon Prince season 1, while K, Petri, and Ulto built Meev’s new game table. We also helped Meev with some chores at the Arch-Meev’s request cause she smol, and then enjoyed a fantastic snack of Southern Comfort eggnog and Cheez-its. At night, Meevcat fell asleep on E’s legs for hours, and E even got to pet Evelynncat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/C1vEEdccSE-Hh8VHRHkXyw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the morning, we said goodbye to two of the three Meevs and set out for Phoenix, accompanied for the first time by Meev’s impressive stereo system and AC demon “Astaroth”. Cissto picked up their rental car on the way to Petri’s apartment, and we were all impressed by the “compact economy” Mustang they showed up in. We got lunch at nearby Zinburger, where we ordered truffle fries and the surprisingly good California Burger Bowl (sub chicken).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Sy8hgkDAQRmd0JVyZ3Jfwg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/2iKP3JUnTK29ce3le9XN6w?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way to the Bryce Thompson Arboretum, we encountered many confusing road work signs but no apparent road work. The signage difficulty continued with “rattlesnakes only” and some questionable navigation by Petri, but the arboretum itself was very nicely maintained and displayed many unique desert environments and T-posers. After seeing Cissto off, we (i.e. K) headbanged the way to our first Airbnb, a nice apartment with an impressive collection of 90’s memorabilia and retro video games. K and Meev played a couple of rounds of pixelated Mario Kart on the N64, then we walked to Sizzle KBBQ. We sent pictures of our bulgogi, pork belly, and seafood pancake to trigger Ulto’s FOMO, then rounded out the evening with MDZS season 1 pain for E.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/kpBBa3tlRKmv2OsDNOercQ?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started off the next day with breakfast at Alo Café, where we :witness:ed Meev pour 16 packets of sugar into her coffee. K ordered the Alo Signature Corn Flake Crusted French Toast while E got the Tortilla Espanola.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/FkyleH64Q0OJ7QrR0KJwzw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then drove to Sedona to kick off our sightseeing tour. First, we did a hike up to Bell Rock, and we were surprised to see snow on the trail. The earth everywhere was also a deep red color due to iron oxide, which created an interesting contrast. We got up to a somewhat precarious position, with a great view of nearby Cathedral Rock and Courthouse Butte.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/bo6t5PVVRpW4dOCFHs2UpA?viewBox=625%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/wUpAIyTqSde9NnuPHWGTng?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Next, we visited the Chapel of the Holy Cross, a large artistic Roman Catholic church. Finally, K had the honor of driving MeevJeep (due to unfortunate tooth pain) along Oak Creek Canyon to Flagstaff, though there was a disappointing lack of parking and trail access on the route. Our Airbnb in Flagstaff was very cozy though, and we settled in with pizza from Fratelli (meat lover’s, pesto cashew, and margherita) and more MDZS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/r-tXUqW3TDayqkAg5pF0TQ?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/GwHcVPDbTGenNHKjbNX_SQ?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/-Ow6z_edTZuWd8raSEJkBA?viewBox=625%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally on Sunday, we set out to see the Grand Canyonion! We started with breakfast at Brandy’s Restaurant &amp;amp; Bakery, where E + K shared a chorizo scramble, hot apple cider, and cream cheese blueberry danish.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/cLKI8tx8QCivECPuHKSCKg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/G5SBPUy2Qy-iHR8-v0n5Bg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A short nap later (yes, we did just wake up), we arrived at the park entrance to South Rim, where Meev’s password of the day, “misery”, was not as successful as the previous time. It was quite chilly at the top of the canyon, and we enjoyed a nice brisk walk to the South Kaibab trailhead along the canyon rim.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/MowBzDi2S7uqNLGOpqnrEQ?viewBox=1404%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/7gsDmRPjSuybFNITR7tolQ?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before starting the trail, we ran into two elk grazing by the parking lot! They did not seem to mind us watching them, and they proudly pranced away after a few minutes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/g7vHDGcGSrSZNyxdsVV8dw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also came across the trail map for the area and felt a bit nervous at the description of points along the hike. We decided to try for Ooh Aah point (moderate difficulty, equivalent to 74 flights of stairs) but not to push our luck to Cedar Ridge (difficult) and Skeleton Point beyond that (very difficult, and scary sounding), or even further to “Contact a park ranger before attempting”. Our Descent (and everyone else, too) started slowly, since it was a bit icy at the top with no railings, but as we made our way down the canyon and out of the shade, we began to warm up. We passed a pack of mules and a sign warning us not to hike to the Colorado River in one day (no problem there), and we eventually made it to Ooh Aah point. It was quite the breathtaking view, and we took some time to take pictures and rest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/jvycJ3Q6R3ugGrveuI0ttw?viewBox=1406%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After an arduous, but surprisingly not too long, hike back up the canyon wall, we went to the Yavapai Tavern for a well-earned lunch of elk chili and winter squash toast. We ended the trip with a visit to the nearby Yavapai Museum of Geology, which had detailed models of the canyon and a great viewing station. K then drove everyone back to the Airbnb, where we watched Monty Python and the Holy Grail and played Taboo (very close game 43-42 between E + K and Meev + Petri!) and Codenames.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/Mk5nB7zbQcapAmFSiauF0w?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last leg of our roadtrip before heading back to Phoenix was to Page and the Navajo territory of Northern Arizona. As we drove past Grand Canyon’s North Rim, we stopped by a group of Navajo stands selling various jewels, pottery, and trinkets. Meev finally found a dreamcatcher she liked, to match the FC logo, and a patterned bowl for the Arch-Meev.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We arrived at Horshoe Bend, which had a very “moderate” hike to the unique view of the lazy Colorado River. E + K sat for a bit popping rock acne. We then went into town for lunch consisting of burgers and fish + chips from Slackers. In the afternoon, we viewed the Glen Canyon Dam, taking photos of our group T-pose shadows, and further down the road (dangerously close to Utah, according to Meev), an overlook over Wahweap Bay. For the rest of the evening, we managed to accomplish the impressive feat of finishing the last two seasons of MDZS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Tuesday, we drove four hours from Flagstaff back to Phoenix. On arrival, we had lunch/dinner at Yutaka Japanese Restaurant, and E + K enjoyed some spicy miso ramen and California rolls.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/V50IoAV2QwGMR96u3dUlnw?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also stopped by a Lowe’s afterwards, where K got a replacement button for his coat and also T-posed the bathroom location for Meev. Unfortunately, Meev’s tooth pain got a lot worse, and we took her to the dentist. The visit was very strange, with the rest of us getting kicked out of the waiting room, and when they wouldn’t let her actually get seen, E almost aggroed the office as Petri tried to carry her back in. Ultimately, there was nothing more to be done besides schedule her an appointment back in Tucson, so we rounded out our time in AZ at the Phoenix Zoo, which had a winter Zoolights event happening. We stopped for some boba, which Meev and Petri really liked (Petri got two!), at Tea Swirl, and then it was finally time to say goodbye. Hug-pats were given all around, and Meev impressively satisfied her dream of picking up E + K (not even in lala form)! We were very touched, and it especially warmed our hearts to see smol Meev so happy at the end of our trip. We’re looking forward to the next time we can all get together again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K went to the city on Sunday intending to do some Sephora returns and to look for gifts for the Arch-Meev (and of course, food!). Unfortunately, we forgot the returns at home, so we did not visit E’s favorite place. But we still had a surprisingly productive day in NYC. Our first stop as usual was Los Tacos No. 1, where we each got two adobada tacos and a horchata to share. E went very hard on the toppings, and K got to try the red salsa this time. After whetting our appetites, we walked to Balthazar bakery in Soho to look for baguette heros for homemade sandwiches, but we found that they were only for wholesale. From there, we decided to go to Ladurée, though we stopped first at Dr. Martens for E to find her combat boot size. At Ladurée, we got a gift box of macarons for Arch-Meev, since it wasn’t something we thought could be easily found in AZ, and a rose croissant for ourselves (which was yummy but could have had more rose flavor in our opinion).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/TZpkRXZDQaKQTcy7JwZZ9A?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since we weren’t able to get a drink and sit down, we also tried out Matchaful, where we chilled for a while looking at FFXIV job memes and sipping Hojicha Latte and Secret Garden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/PiR64DTBRHmbOPayVX3kZw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the way back, we passed by a giant A, which we initially laughed at and sent to the Dream discord. But upon seeing the inside of the pasta bar and noticing truffle (aaaaa) on the menu, we stepped inside for dinner. We ordered the $100 pasta sampler, consisting of five half-dishes for two, and were blown away by the food. First came the Tonnarelli Cacio E Pepe (black pepper) and Tagliatelle Al Tartufo Nero (truffle aaaaa), which were perfectly complemented by the Rigatoni All ‘Arrabbiata (spicy tomato), and E + K were already in carb + umami heaven. There was so much generous truffle flavor, and the perfect bounciness of the pasta combined with plating/presentation set this restaurant far apart from previous Italian places we had tried. We looked like savages fighting each other over soaking up the remaining sauces with bread. When we thought the food couldn’t get any better, out came the Tortelli Mantovani Di Zucca (pumpkin/pear/lemon zest/nutmeg/butter/sage!!). This was the most unique dish of the night, and E + K agreed that A deserved a Michelin star for this dish. We could taste every ingredient/flavor without any of them overpowering the others, and it was so delicious even with E dying from fullness. Finally, to end the meal and night, we got the 24K Gold Spaghetti (squid ink/sea urchin), which drew looks from the neighboring tables. While the squid ink was on the salty side by itself, when combined with the uni and amazingly juicy tomato, it became absolutely perfect.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Satisfied and somewhat delirious, we made the much-needed walk back to WTC while marveling at how we keep randomly stumbling on such amazing food experiences with so little effort :drool:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K did some homecooking for Thanksgiving this year after grocery shopping the day before. We started a chicken broil in the slow cooker on Thanksgiving eve, then added tofu knots, black fungus, and shiitake mushrooms in the morning. For lunch, we finished some leftover mozzarella sandwich ingredients, tomato egg soup, and curry noodles, while we waited for the broil and prepped dinner ingredients. K made butternut squash soup and blueberry muffins (first time baker!), and E made turkey bacon-wrapped asparagus, roasted carrots, kale salad, and some overly spicy potatoes (E mistook cayenne pepper as paprika :p). While we cooked and ate our yummy meal, we watched old episodes of Glee!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K went to the Christian Dior: Designer of Dreams exhibit at the Brooklyn museum. On the way, we stopped by Los Tacos No. 1 for two adobada tacos and a horchata. We got the tacos loaded with everything, and K even used all three salsas - we then proceeded to discuss those tacos for the entire walk to The Real Real for returns. At noon, we met up with D + A at Vinegar Hill House, which had some very unique takes on breakfast foods. K ordered a large sourdough blueberry pancake, which reminded E of a burnt cheesecake, and E got a very fluffy omelette that K thought had a very interesting texture on the inside.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After walking D + A and their new tiny puppy C back to their apartment, we headed to the museum. We learned a lot about the history of Dior, and the fashion world in general, such as the fact that YSL succeeded Dior at the age of only 21. The displays were quite well done, especially the collections of works by all the heads of Dior throughout the couture’s history. It was very interesting seeing the design trends over time, though K’s favorite was still the dress with the lion’s head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the museum, we got dinner at a Laotian restaurant called Khe-yo, though this was one of the more lackluster meals we have had in NYC.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/vU2zo3xER6-AT2SmyWqaMQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the rest of the evening, we did some heavy TEA prog, clearing Wormhole and seeing J-waves for the first time. Then we watched Last Night in Soho, just a tad late for Halloween. It ended up being a lot less scary than expected, though the cinematography was great, and E actually watched most of the movie without a blanket over her eyes, while K got away with just telling the TV “No” one time.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Esha Wang</name></author><category term="travel" /><summary type="html">November 20, 2021</summary></entry><entry><title type="html">Snigdha and Udaya’s Engagement</title><link href="/snigdhaandudaya-2021-11-06/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Snigdha and Udaya’s Engagement" /><published>2021-11-06T00:00:00-04:00</published><updated>2021-11-06T00:00:00-04:00</updated><id>/snigdhaandudaya-2021-11-06</id><content type="html" xml:base="/snigdhaandudaya-2021-11-06/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;november-6-2021&quot;&gt;November 6, 2021&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Saturday, E + K went on a morning run at Liberty State Park. Afterwards, we got lunch at Café Dolma in downtown JC, where we ordered Poached Eggs with Kiymali, Sautéed Spinach with Labneh, and Fingerling Za’atar Potatoes. We went to Trader Joe’s to stock up on ingredients and snacks, and later in the day, we got our delivery from Monterey’s Tasty Olive Bar, which E used to make a delicious arugula, avocado, and blueberry goat cheese salad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday, we went to Chelsea Market and got Chicken &amp;amp; Sausage Jambalaya and Cream of Tomato with Chicken and Orzo soups and a California Melt from Hale and Hearty Soups for lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/iO5dqZfwSnSAR6vuSGVwjg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then, we went to see Porgy and Bess at the Met Opera, which we found quite stunning and surreal after seeing it in so many movies. We were so stunned that we didn’t make it to our seats in time for the show to start, and we had to watch the first scene of the first act from a screen. During that time, we realized we couldn’t understand any of the songs they were singing (uncultured af) and began to worry we would be sitting through 3.5 hours of gibberish. K pulled up the plot synopsis on Wikipedia, which helped, but when we reached our seats, we found that each one had a small screen that showed subtitles for the songs. This was a total game changer, and the rest of the opera was very enjoyable.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the show, we met up with I, who was in town for a business trip, and tried to get a seat at Momofuku Noodle Bar. The line was too long, however, so we went to Donburiya instead, where we ordered Katsudon and California Don, along with some taro croquettes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Friday night, P and L came over to our apartment to stay the weekend. P and L are doctors in residency, and vacation days are hard to come by, so it was nice to see them after such a long time. That night, E presented P with her belated birthday gift - a baby pink robe. P loved it so much that she insisted on keeping both sizes small (for herself) and medium (for L), even though a large would have suited L much better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next morning, E, P, and L (K was unfortunately on tapeout) met up with D and A for brunch at The Osprey in Dumbo. The restaurant was located inside a fancy hotel, and E thought the decor was fantastic. E ordered the Osprey Breakfast, which was surprisingly filling. E even gave her leftovers to L, who was still hungry after finishing his meal. D and A also brought their new puppy C, an adorable one-month old toy maltese, who obediently sat on P’s lap for most of the time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, D and A drove E, P, and L to their next appointment at the Museum of Ice Cream. Despite being a little late to the event, we were able to sufficiently stuff ourselves with ice cream and various desserts while being bombarded with pink walls and neon lights.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;L was particularly excited to see a basketball hoop, and proceeded to have a dodgeball fight with P, while E took pictures of them the whole time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/__zn8KiBRcugsOsZIw6l4g?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we finished exploring the museum, E took P and L to Bao Tea House (because we obviously weren’t full enough), and ordered some pork belly, fried chicken, and beef bao, along with a rose grapefruit tea for E. Even though we did not order too much, we all ended up incredibly full, which was not a great sign since P and L had dinner plans with another friend immediately after.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/KM2s5IuFQW2-5E7ahg08ow?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then parted ways for the time being, and E headed over to Nyonya to have dinner with K, Steven, and Evelyn, who were staying in the city for a few weeks as well. We ordered the classic half Hainanese chicken (E’s favorite), roti canai, chow kueh teow, and chendol for dessert. Afterwards, E and K felt a bit tired and headed home, while P and L went to a comedy club in the city. When P and L got back, we all relaxed to a few episodes of The Dragon Prince before heading off to bed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/0apD3EguRRqH5Syg5CO2Bg?viewBox=1249%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On Sunday morning, E, P, and L took the train to Chelsea Market, where E excitedly showed off her favorite places to eat. We started off with Los Tacos No. 1, where we ordered the adobada and pollo asado tacos. We all easily agreed that the adobada was probably the best tasting tacos we have ever had, despite P and L living in LA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/gTcQiIvoTZ2tQBopFnuwiQ?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Afterwards, we stopped by Filaga Pizzeria, where we ordered a slice of the Bufalina and Mediterannea. P especially enjoyed the Bufalina, and was impressed by how fresh the mozzarella was. Meanwhile E and L’s favorite was the Mediterannea because of the unique toppings and overall blend of flavors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/EG0BMoRZS1CfroOFZBKZPw?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We then stopped by Mokbar to order japchae dumplings and ho cake. P was pleasantly surprised with how tasty the japchae dumplings were, despite them being vegan. At our last stop, we went to The Lobster Place to order the lobster roll and clam chowder. P and L have not had too many lobster rolls in the past, so it was difficult for them to rank, but there was no doubt that the texture and flavor were superb.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://thumbnails-photos.amazon.com/v1/thumbnail/gmL5APCDShKf8_6nsBsXgg?viewBox=703%2C937&amp;amp;ownerId=A162HQHSXNNQIH&amp;amp;groupShareToken=utZYY3mwTpGX7bOjEzZGtw.gC8ZExI67DaZhaH_9bzTAd&quot; alt=&quot;image&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To walk off some of the food we ate, we then did a little shopping in the area. We briefly stopped by Anthropologie just to gawk at the price tags, though there was an interesting display of a small forest made entirely from denim fabric.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We also stopped by a fragrance store called Sabon, where E bought a little bottle of perfume called White Tea. Finally, we did a little shopping at E and P’s one true love, Aritzia. E bought a sweater, while P tried on a few items and L went upstairs to take a nap on the couch. After our short excursion, it was time to eat again, and we were off to Chinatown to meet up with K and have dinner at Joe’s Shanghai. Luckily, we arrived slightly before the dinner rush, and we were able to get a table after only about twenty minutes of waiting. We started off ordering two stacks of crab and pork soup dumplings. E warned P that these dumplings were the best soup dumplings she has ever had and significantly tastier than Din Tai Fung’s. It seemed like P agreed, since she nearly requested to order two more stacks of soup dumplings! We decided to settle on one more instead. We also ordered some pork dumplings, green beans, and a chili oil fish dish, all of which were thoroughly delicious.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we finished our meal, P pulled a sneaky trick on us, saying that she needed to go to the bathroom, but instead generously paid for our entire meal. All too soon, it was time for P and L to take their train back to Connecticut, where L’s parents resided. E and K walked them to their train station where we said our goodbyes, all the while being reminded that we have some pretty amazing friends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K went to the city to watch Chicago The Musical at the Ambassador Theater on Broadway. Beforehand, we stopped by Té Company to buy a few boxes of Pineapple Linzer cookies as gifts for our upcoming trip to Norcal. For dinner, we went to Joe’s Home of Soup Dumplings again, where K was so engrossed in the food that he left the boxes of cookies at the table. We realized something was missing just as the show started, and K had to run to the restaurant and back (1.2 miles on a full stomach)! He ended up missing Cell Block Tango, but the cookies were fortunately safe.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E + K were late with their anniversary cook-off this year, but we finally found a weekend to duke it out. As is tradition, our menu items were held secret until our shopping trip to 99 Ranch and Trader Joe’s. K was in a Thai mood and wanted to try some real deep frying with our new wok, so he made spring rolls with cabbage + carrots mix, Persian cucumbers, mint, green onion, cilantro, and vermicelli with homemade peanut sauce using peanut butter, sesame oil, soy sauce, rice vinegar, and honey and fried sea bream with six heads(!!) of garlic and turmeric (oh god the staining though). We used the leftover oil from deep frying for the next month :joy:.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;E’s main dish was a soba noodle stir-fry with salmon, ginger, broccolini, and edamame. E also made some dango for dessert, inspired by Monster Hunter Rise. Unlike the traditional dango recipe, which uses only glutinous rice flour as a base, E also added some silken tofu into the mix to make the texture softer and a bit more chewy. Unfortunately, E could not find any strawberry powder at 99 Ranch, but ended up making some tasty sesame, milk, and matcha flavored dango.&lt;/p&gt;
